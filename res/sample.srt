1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:04,952
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:11,339
Should I begin?

3
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:12,382
MAY, 2011

4
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:13,466
Well…

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,719
Hello.

6
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:21,266
<i>My name is Choi Ung.</i>

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:22,851
CHOI UNG (19, MALE)

8
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,311
Let's look at the first one.

9
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:26,813
As limit x approaches one,

10
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:29,524
you can find the limiting value.

11
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:33,236
So we can think about
the case when it's smaller than one

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,824
and when it's bigger than one. Understand?

13
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:41,244
-Okay. When it's smaller than one…
-Don't look at the camera.

14
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:44,497
-But it bothers me.
-Just act like it's not here.

15
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,417
How can I? It's right in front of me.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,086
For this case, it goes down like this.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,464
<i>-As you can see…</i>
-So the answer is…

18
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:54,090
<i>I'm being filmed.</i>

19
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:55,759
You idiot. Look forward.

20
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:57,844
Should we look at the next one?

21
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:01,389
-The limiting value of this is one.
<i>-But it's not just me.</i>

22
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,725
What are you looking at?
Look at the teacher.

23
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,936
The limiting value of this is one as well.

24
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,898
The limiting values of these are the same…

25
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:12,108
<i>This annoying brat as well.</i>

26
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,318
Let's end it here.

27
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,571
Attention, bow.

28
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,865
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

29
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:21,618
Where are you going?

30
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:24,412
It's none of your business.

31
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:34,464
Sir, can we stop for a moment?
I can't keep working with that idiot.

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,842
-"Idiot"?
-We've been filming for days.

33
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,511
Why can't you sit still
when we're filming?

34
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:42,138
I can't focus at all with you next to me.

35
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:44,432
How can I
when there is a camera right next to me?

36
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:47,227
Just focus on the class.
Can't you even do that?

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,188
You can ignore me
and focus on class yourself.

38
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:51,147
Can't you even do that?

39
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:54,734
I guess you don't care because
your grades couldn't get any worse.

40
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:57,404
But I won't let you bring down my grades.

41
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,991
You heard her, right?

42
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:04,452
Whatever. It's your social skills
that couldn't get any worse.

43
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,706
Why did I agree to this?

44
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,542
I know, right? Why did you agree to this?

45
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:14,587
<i>My name is Kook Yeon-su.</i>

46
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,505
KOOK YEON-SU (19, FEMALE)

47
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,967
<i>I think I first saw Choi Ung
in tenth grade.</i>

48
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,470
This much again?

49
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,764
I'm reading less
because I have exams soon.

50
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:27,976
You'll read all the books here
by the time you graduate.

51
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,102
Kook Yeon-su…

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,106
-Here. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,446
APRIL'S TOP BOOKWORMS

54
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,072
1ST: CHOI UNG
2ND: KOOK YEON-SU

55
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,118
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

56
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,661
Who is Choi Ung?

57
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,413
He's in first place this month, too?

58
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,206
Oh, Ung?

59
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,584
I think he was over there.

60
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,922
Hey.

61
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,968
<i>I met him somewhere that didn't suit him.</i>

62
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,428
I'm Kook Yeon-su from Class 5.

63
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,221
What's your rank?

64
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,015
-What rank?
-Your grades.

65
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:09,809
I'm 267th.

66
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,480
The total number of students here…

67
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,565
There are 267 students.

68
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,486
<i>Back then, I just thought
that he was a strange kid.</i>

69
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:27,243
<i>No, wait. That was the second time we met.</i>

70
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:30,080
<i>The first time we met
was when we started high school.</i>

71
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,583
The student who entered with
the highest grades is Kook Yeon-su.

72
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,296
Her name's Kook Yeon-su?

73
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,048
What a funny name.

74
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:44,135
I watched her because she walked
like she was entering a battlefield.

75
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:50,725
HWIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

76
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,603
Hey, look at her skirt.

77
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,314
-She's obviously a teacher's pet.
-She's a stereotype.

78
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:59,901
-They all have the same style.
-Hey, look at her shoes.

79
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,945
Even my mom wouldn't wear that.

80
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,906
-Spring is finally here.
-How tacky.

81
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,450
The weather is still pretty cold.

82
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,369
<i>We met eyes for the first time,</i>

83
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,412
<i>so I was trying to be nice by smiling.</i>

84
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:12,580
Hey.

85
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:14,249
What are you looking at?

86
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:19,087
<i>But she seemed ill-tempered.</i>

87
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:32,225
<i>Anyway, I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.</i>

88
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,519
You're here.

89
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,354
Did you think about that offer?

90
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,231
The producer's a friend of mine.

91
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,732
He won't trouble you too much.

92
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:42,026
You don't have to
if you think it will affect your grades.

93
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:45,196
-Will it be just me?
-No, with one more student.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,242
It's a documentary where
they observe the best and worst students

95
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,327
for a month as they spend time together.

96
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:54,372
Anyway, just think about it.

97
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,089
Will I be paid if I agree to do it?

98
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,549
Of course.

99
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:13,308
<i>He was the exact opposite of me.</i>

100
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,729
Oh, you're here already.

101
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,980
-Hang on.
-All right.

102
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,858
Just a moment.

103
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,986
The ingredients must be here.
Check them thoroughly.

104
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,238
They were in a bad condition last time.

105
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,199
-Check them properly.
-All right.

106
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:33,745
SEAFOOD SOUP WITH UNG
POTATO SOUP WITH UNG

107
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,371
CHICKEN FEET WITH UNG

108
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,832
-Hello.
-Hello.

109
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,627
He's Ung's father.

110
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,629
-Hello.
-Hello.

111
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,339
Ung!

112
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,341
-Hey. Come over here.
<i>-But things happened</i>

113
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:48,885
<i>regardless of my intentions.</i>

114
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,970
Why didn't you tell us
about the documentary?

115
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:53,014
I said I wouldn't do it.

116
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:56,684
The producer came all the way here.
Why did you say no?

117
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:59,395
And it's with
the top student in your year.

118
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,730
Of course you should do it!

119
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:04,901
Of course! We don't know
what he's doing at school.

120
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:07,445
If you film that,
we'll be able to see what he does.

121
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,614
-That's right.
-Thank you.

122
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:11,574
-Thank you.
-I said I'm not doing it!

123
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:13,117
Why would you refuse?

124
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,120
Why would I do that?
I don't want everyone to know my face.

125
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,665
You'll be able
to build a great memory with this.

126
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,583
-Right.
-I'm a senior now, you know.

127
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,961
Don't you think it will affect my grades?

128
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,047
What's he on about?

129
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,925
They are letting you study
with the top student in your grade.

130
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,677
You should be grateful!

131
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,678
I mean…

132
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,555
<i>It was as if it had to happen.</i>

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,683
She's kind of weird!

134
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:40,436
<i>Anyway, that's how it all started.</i>

135
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:49,153
Choi Ung from Class 1
will be joining us for a month.

136
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,071
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:51,447
Be nice to him.

138
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:55,201
It may be distracting for you
since they'll be filming,

139
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,245
but it will be a fun experience.

140
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:01,916
And with that,
I hope you all have a great day.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,959
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,360
<i>It was more bothersome than I thought.</i>

143
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:43,499
The worst students make the most fuss.

144
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,795
-Are you talking to me?
-Keep your stuff off my desk.

145
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,060
<i>She was way more annoying than I thought.</i>

146
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,111
<i>At first, I tried
to become friends with her.</i>

147
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,321
Hey…

148
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,170
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,976
Can we…

150
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,194
I said I was sorry.

151
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,489
I'm not sorry.

152
00:08:58,533 --> 00:08:59,701
<i>But what can I do?</i>

153
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,744
<i>We're just so different.</i>

154
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,664
No! Not here!

155
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:07,542
Darn it.

156
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,377
Go!

157
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,213
Here.

158
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,927
-Hey.
-Over here!

159
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,806
Oh, my.

160
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:24,183
Darn it. Hey!

161
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:25,810
Oh, gosh!

162
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:35,820
Are you okay?

163
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,745
<i>He's so childish.</i>

164
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:45,580
Ma'am.

165
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,042
How can I solve that
with the L'Hôpital's rule?

166
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,795
Ma'am.

167
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:57,049
Can we solve this
by using the derived function?

168
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,176
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

169
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,720
-Ma'am.
-All right, kids. Enjoy your lunch.

170
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:02,054
Ma'am.

171
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,558
<i>She's so selfish.</i>

172
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,642
Ma'am.

173
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:08,728
<i>THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING</i>

174
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,482
I love lying in the shade.

175
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,401
The gentle breeze,

176
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,696
the sunlight shining through the trees…

177
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,118
You're so ridiculous.

178
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,163
Can you move?

179
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:30,374
Finish reading that
and return it to the library.

180
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,759
This is so nice.

181
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,095
<i>He's so lazy.</i>

182
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,075
Who was that?

183
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,662
Choi Ung! You again?

184
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,705
I told you to be quiet!

185
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:13,042
<i>Things are already exhausting,</i>

186
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,503
<i>but she just makes it worse.</i>

187
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:18,631
<i>He's just so pathetic.</i>

188
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,428
Sorry. What was the question?

189
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,472
Pay attention.

190
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,101
Oh, things I hate?

191
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,352
Kook Yeon-su.

192
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:37,650
I mean, I hate Kook Yeong-su.
She's some girl I know.

193
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:42,280
I hate pathetic beings.
I hate everyone who's pathetic.

194
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,323
Being selfish. I hate selfish people who--

195
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,158
People who cause trouble for others.

196
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:49,829
Why can't they just keep to themselves
and not drag others down with them?

197
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,122
Being harsh.

198
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,790
Some people talk without thinking.

199
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,458
They don't think at all.

200
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,085
Look who's talking.

201
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,463
He just doesn't think at all.

202
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:02,383
Wait. Are you talking about me?

203
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,719
You seemed to be talking about me too.

204
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,971
What? Are you kidding me?

205
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,389
No, I'm totally serious.

206
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,059
Why are you filming this again?

207
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:15,187
It's a show where the top student helps
the student at the bottom of the class.

208
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:17,064
-Right?
-I see.

209
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,149
Is this some kind of a test

210
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:20,484
to see how long you can withstand
someone who has no social skills?

211
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:23,863
Doing experiments like that
is pretty unethical.

212
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:27,950
The best student and the worst student.
Which is more anti-social?

213
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:29,952
When people like her enter society,

214
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,705
they will only tire out
the people around them.

215
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:35,917
Well, you wouldn't even
be able to participate in society.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,710
How would you know?

217
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:44,717
What do you think
you'll be like in ten years?

218
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:51,015
In ten years, I'll be 29.

219
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:55,519
I'm sure I'd be good at
whatever I'm doing.

220
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,649
I want to live a peaceful life
without doing anything.

221
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:03,694
I'll be leading people around me,
living an active life.

222
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:04,737
A successful life.

223
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,698
I hope I'll live a quiet life.

224
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:09,992
-Anyway…
-One thing I know for sure is that--

225
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,536
…I won't have to see
this annoying face again.

226
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,206
That's what I wanted to say.

EPISODE 1
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

236
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,131
<i>This isn't it.</i>

237
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:06,048
THE PRESENT

238
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:07,466
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

239
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,844
Yes.

240
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:13,556
I don't think you have
anything more to add. Will you continue?

241
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,726
<i>This isn't the life I thought I'd live.</i>

242
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,398
But still, please listen
until the end and give me your opinion.

243
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,984
All right, then. Continue.

244
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,445
I will explain
the online promotion methods.

245
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:30,990
We're planning on gaining
people's interest before the opening

246
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:34,493
through online campaigns
and participation events.

247
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:36,912
And through hashtag events--

248
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,039
Ms. Kook.

249
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:40,124
This is pretty disappointing.

250
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,168
This isn't what we asked for.

251
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,045
You should have
checked with us in advance.

252
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:47,173
Your ideas are too mediocre.

253
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:50,509
To attract people's interests
before the store opens,

254
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:53,554
-we should do online--
-Don't you think I know that?

255
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:56,182
-But we--
-Your company's name is Run, right?

256
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,391
You're a small company,

257
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,977
but you won quite a lot of awards,

258
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,354
and I heard you're
quite famous in the industry.

259
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:05,024
But your work is pathetic.

260
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,110
You've built up a great image
for your company, I'll give you that.

261
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:11,739
Ji-hyeon. The presentation this afternoon…

262
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,866
Can we reschedule it to 10 a.m.?

263
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,285
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes? You're done, right?

264
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:17,369
Is there anything else?

265
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:22,333
<i>Getting looked down on like this
was never part of my plan.</i>

266
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,461
-Yes. I'm not done yet.
-Hurry up, then.

267
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,889
Offline,
we'll be collaborating with an artist

268
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,849
for the opening of Soen Shop.

269
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,435
Isn't it cliché to use merch
to attract customers?

270
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,688
It isn't very effective
and is a waste of resources.

271
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:45,981
Consumers won't fall for--

272
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,569
Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?

273
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:53,989
Go on.

274
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:58,035
This isn't just so that we could
lure in customers with the merchandise.

275
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:02,498
We'll be merchandising the shop itself
to promote the company.

276
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,420
These are the works of Ko-o,
the most popular illustrator these days.

277
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:12,758
Ko-o is known for drawing detailed
and trendy pieces based on buildings.

278
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:17,304
And recently, Ko-o received more attention
as the idol singer NJ bought one of them.

279
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,807
Through this collaboration,

280
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,893
we'll host a live drawing show
for the opening ceremony.

281
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:25,938
Go on.

282
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:29,900
The artist's image matches
the unique and innovative goods

283
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,070
that Soen Shop aims
to provide its customers.

284
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:36,532
Ko-o already has a large fanbase
because of his unique drawings

285
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,993
and his sincere attitude toward art.

286
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:41,829
If we promote the shop
with his drawing on the exterior wall,

287
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:46,458
I'm sure it will make Soen Shop
the hottest place to visit.

288
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:55,759
Can you get the artist on board?

289
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,095
Of course. It won't be a problem.

290
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,930
You'd better be right.

291
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,975
ARTIST KO-O

292
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,268
Not bad.

293
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:08,314
I don't know why you waited
until the last minute to show us that.

294
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:09,940
-The order--
-You can proceed.

295
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:29,043
Ms. Kook. That was great.
You were so cool today.

296
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:33,380
I heard Mr. Jang is very aggressive.
He sure was scary.

297
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,257
He's doing that on purpose.

298
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:38,302
He called us over this early
so he could have the upper hand.

299
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:40,054
He even kept cutting her off.

300
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,389
But still,
we have this project in the bag now.

301
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:46,352
But Ms. Kook. Can we really
get the artist to work with us?

302
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,730
I thought that wasn't confirmed yet.

303
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,566
That jerk…

304
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:02,576
When we get back to the office,
get me all the data on the artist.

305
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,037
Everything from his social media
to his interviews.

306
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,706
We have to do this project no matter what.

307
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,502
But the artist is known
for being a recluse.

308
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:14,630
Nobody's seen his face,
even at exhibitions.

309
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,175
I'm going to find him, no matter what.

310
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,056
How could he cut me off like that?

311
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:26,100
Did he never learn any manners?

312
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,519
Jeez, where is my car?

313
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:48,289
Mr. Jang.

314
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,292
Did you have something to say to me?

315
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:55,963
Are you opening my car door for me?

316
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:57,006
What?

317
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,933
I'm sorry. I haven't gotten used
to the company car yet.

318
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,059
I was mistaken.

319
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,522
-Ms. Kook.
-Yes?

320
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,232
I hate baseless courage.

321
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:18,819
I think irresponsible people
are the most pathetic.

322
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:21,989
-Right.
-I hope you weren't bluffing

323
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:24,325
when you said you could
get the artist on board.

324
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,577
You're not that pathetic, are you?

325
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:43,761
<i>Ten years ago…</i>

326
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,095
That jerk…

327
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,557
<i>…I would have never imagined</i>

328
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,517
<i>that I'd be treated this way.</i>

329
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:01,320
<i>I had always known</i>

330
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,698
<i>that my life would be peaceful.</i>

331
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,746
<i>I've always dreamed of this.</i>

332
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:15,250
We started a restaurant
for drivers passing by.

333
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,835
-Hang on.
-Why?

334
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,921
Wait. What's he doing?

335
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:21,507
Stop acting so weird back there.

336
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,884
I have to film Dad,
but you're being distracting.

337
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,678
You ruined the shot. It's your fault.

338
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,264
Stop bothering us and go inside.

339
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,183
But I was here first.

340
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,936
I thought I'd be fine talking
in front of the camera,

341
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,521
but it's quite nerve-racking.

342
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:39,108
<i>-I want a little more peace though.</i>
-Our franchise began

343
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:43,904
as a diner for drivers 25 years ago.

344
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:48,283
We specialized in
steamed fish and chicken feet.

345
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,911
-Then word got around--
-Stop it already!

346
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:52,204
You ruined the shot!

347
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:54,373
He's a busy man, you know.

348
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:56,375
Ung, you should go.
Aren't you late for work?

349
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,584
It's fine. I have time.

350
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:59,294
Then eat something before you go.

351
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:01,797
Don't you dare!

352
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,090
You little brat.

353
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:05,092
Stop loafing around and work on this.

354
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:08,053
Don't you think I'm busy too?

355
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,221
-Nonsense.
-Ridiculous.

356
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,224
You? Busy? You're not even working.

357
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:13,767
-Hey, put that away.
-Come on.

358
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:16,270
He's spending
his precious time helping us.

359
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,813
You should be thanking him.

360
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,314
You little brat.

361
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:21,650
Finish up and watch the counter.

362
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,693
And don't run away.

363
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:24,695
-Honey, help me with something.
-Wait, I…

364
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:25,946
I can't do it by myself.

365
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,407
Jeez. I'd better go.

366
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,869
I told you to stop filming.

367
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:35,205
You'd better stop if you don't
want to lose your fingers or the camera.

368
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,583
What happened to your face?

369
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:42,087
-Even pork is marinated for eight hours.
-What do you mean?

370
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,256
I only slept
two and a half hours last night.

371
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,049
I got less rest than pork.

372
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:49,970
That's too bad. You sleep and poop
as much as a pig though.

373
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:51,763
Shut up. And stop filming!

374
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:55,476
But I was told to film you too
for the promotional video.

375
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,144
No way. Don't you dare.

376
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:58,562
Ung!

377
00:21:58,645 --> 00:21:59,563
-Yes?
-Yes?

378
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:00,772
Ung.

379
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,108
Over here. Look at the camera.

380
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:06,195
That's right.

381
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,238
How cute.

382
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,204
-Look over here.
-Ung! Look at Mommy.

383
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:16,330
-Ung! Over here.
-That's right.

384
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,290
-Look at your teacher.
-How cute!

385
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:19,416
Hang on.

386
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,210
Look at your teacher. Yes, good.

387
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:23,003
-Look over there.
-He grew a lot.

388
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,047
-It must be because your husband is tall.
-Look at your teacher.

389
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,840
Is he listening to his teacher?

390
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,342
I bought this for today.

391
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,219
"Choi Ung"?

392
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:33,263
Yes. I'm Choi Ung. What's your name?

393
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:34,806
I'm not going to tell you.

394
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:39,186
KIM JI-UNG

395
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,479
<i>Not you. Ji-ung.</i>

396
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:41,730
Do you want some stew?

397
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:43,899
-Yes, I'd love that.
-What about me?

398
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:45,317
You can have some too.

399
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:49,446
Hey, I've been thinking…

400
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,823
I'll practice my lines properly,

401
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:55,160
so would it be okay
to do this again when you have time?

402
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:58,622
Anytime is fine with me.
So call me when you want to do it.

403
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:03,794
Thank you so much.
It's so nice having a producer help out.

404
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:05,754
When else would I be able to try this?

405
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:09,967
Dad. Don't look at me like that.

406
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,969
The cabbages are arriving later, okay?

407
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:15,013
Don't you dare think about running away
and move them inside.

408
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:18,559
I hope you're not forgetting
that I'm your son!

409
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,020
-Have two bowls, alright?
-Okay.

410
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:26,692
It seems like you'll be the one
inheriting the restaurant later.

411
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:29,361
My parents are acting
like you're their son these days.

412
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:32,197
But think about it.

413
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:34,449
I act more like their son than you.

414
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,576
Jeez.

415
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,035
Aren't you working these days?

416
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,038
Why do you keep lurking around here
and threatening my status?

417
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:42,874
I finally got a short vacation
after finishing a program.

418
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,086
I'll be busy again
when I start my next project.

419
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,589
I should have fun here before that.

420
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:51,550
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

421
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,927
-I'm having fun.
-You jerk!

422
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:56,930
Wait! Father, look at Ung
holding the bean sprouts like that!

423
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:58,765
-I wasn't--
-Put that down!

424
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,142
Put it down.

425
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:01,643
-Put it down!
-Don't play around with that!

426
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:02,936
You're dead, you jerk!

427
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,647
-How can you be so childish?
-My goodness.

428
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:07,149
You're a grown-up, you know!

429
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:11,653
<i>I thought I'd have matured
a bit more than this though.</i>

430
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,492
Ms. Kook and Mr. Jang
were clashing since they're so similar.

431
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,536
It's so fun watching them argue.

432
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,539
You saw how Ms. Kook reacted
when Mr. Jang cut her off

433
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,625
during her presentation, right?

434
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:28,712
"Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?" Unbelievable.

435
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:31,423
But still, Ms. Kook was so cool.
Don't you think so?

436
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:32,883
She's cool.

437
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,969
It wasn't something a small company
like us can easily get.

438
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,096
But she's getting that opportunity for us.

439
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,641
She's almost like
the breadwinner of this family.

440
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,601
Our CEO's good luck charm.

441
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:45,229
But imagine if we get on her bad side.

442
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,816
She's so dependable
when she's fighting our clients,

443
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,692
but if she ever gets angry at us…

444
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:52,820
Polar bears tear people apart
with their paws,

445
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:55,864
but Ms. Kook tears people with her words…
How did it go, Ms. Kook?

446
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:59,243
The data I asked for on Ko-o.

447
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:00,953
Have them ready by 3 p.m.

448
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,287
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

449
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,253
What's going on here? What is it?

450
00:25:09,336 --> 00:25:11,255
Why are you guys so good?

451
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,382
I heard you were given the green light.

452
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,300
I was so shocked.

453
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:16,927
Good work.

454
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,223
And I can't believe Ms. Kook
succeeded again.

455
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:23,100
Today's a day to celebrate.

456
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:24,726
-We should--
-No gatherings.

457
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,353
I'm not suggesting a team dinner.

458
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,230
Why would we do such a thing?

459
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:31,400
We shouldn't be having
a company gathering at a time like this.

460
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,609
We all hate it.

461
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:34,778
Then how about

462
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,697
-dinner--
-How about lunch instead?

463
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,575
You don't want to waste
your dinnertime with me?

464
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,952
That's not what I mean.
It's going to be hard

465
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:43,829
to get off work on time.

466
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:45,706
Then should we go have lunch now?

467
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:48,250
We already had lunch, sir.

468
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:52,421
What do you mean?

469
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:53,589
I just remembered

470
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:57,009
that we all had lunch together
on the way back.

471
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:02,639
What about me? Why didn't you invite me?

472
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:06,977
You didn't attend the presentation
because you had a stomachache.

473
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,646
So we thought you'd skip lunch.

474
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,482
Right. That was smart thinking.

475
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,944
Then you don't want dinner,
and you already ate lunch.

476
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:17,195
What should I do, then?

477
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,907
Then how about some coffee?

478
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,408
-Yes.
-Coffee sounds great.

479
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:23,535
-You all have coffee.
-We have coffee.

480
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:25,412
You already have coffee.

481
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,372
You all have some.

482
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,957
-Yes.
-Fine.

483
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,668
-Why don't I get you some porridge, then?
-Don't worry.

484
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:34,963
I hate porridge.

485
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:37,633
He seems upset.

486
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:52,230
SOL-I

487
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:05,452
SEOUL HARDWARE STORE

488
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:35,477
What is it?

489
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,687
<i>You wench! Why weren't you picking up?</i>

490
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,151
Why weren't you picking up?

491
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:45,821
Jeez. Don't you see that I'm working?

492
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:48,073
But still, you should answer your phone.

493
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,908
Darn it…

494
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,076
What?

495
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,870
What are you doing? Hey!

496
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,163
Get up. Exercise time.

497
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,249
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

498
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,793
Get up. You said you're not sleeping well.

499
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:01,670
Stop it! Let go of me!

500
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:06,883
It's the manager's job
to take care of the artist's health too.

501
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:11,972
I'm already exhausted,
and he makes it worse.

502
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:14,641
Aren't I a great manager? I'm so kind.

503
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:15,892
You're fired.

504
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,561
That counts as wrongful dismissal.

505
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:20,021
We'll stop when we
make it over there. You can do it.

506
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:21,273
I can't.

507
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:22,816
You have to go. Come on.

508
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,276
-Jeez.
-One, two, three, four.

509
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,652
Two, two, three, four.

510
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:27,904
All right! We're here!

511
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:29,406
Over here. Hurry up.

512
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,907
Hey! What's that?

513
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,409
The flag. Make the goal.

514
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,163
-There you go.
-Yes, goal!

515
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:41,126
You guys are doing all kinds
of stupid things.

516
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,545
I heard you only slept
two and a half hours.

517
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,590
-You have such a big mouth.
-Me? Take this.

518
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:47,883
Gosh.

519
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:50,260
Aren't you supposed to be busy?
Did you get fired?

520
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,888
Hey, if you're skilled,
you can slack off all you want.

521
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,435
Right. Did you still not
tell your parents what you do?

522
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:00,395
They just know I'm drawing.

523
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:03,815
They called me a while ago
and asked if you make enough money

524
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,401
since they couldn't find anything
when they searched your name.

525
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:07,903
Didn't you tell them anything?

526
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,530
How much do you earn? Tell me.

527
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:12,699
You're not even telling your family?

528
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:14,784
You're being overly secretive.

529
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:17,204
-Darn it.
-Jeez!

530
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,498
-You shook it, didn't you?
-No. So how much does he earn?

531
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,876
Each drawing sells for…

532
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:25,795
-What? For real?
-Yes.

533
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:27,339
Son of a bitch.

534
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:31,801
Hey. You just
wanted to swear at me, right?

535
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:32,844
Of course not.

536
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:35,138
Son of a bitch. What?

537
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:39,392
Oh, right. I told Father
that you didn't move the cabbages.

538
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:41,019
He said he'll kill you tomorrow.

539
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:43,563
-Oh, my. What are you going to do?
-Darn it.

540
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,072
Why is the weather so nice today?

541
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:02,791
-Jeez!
-Jeez!

542
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:04,751
You idiots.

543
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:07,921
-You shook these, didn't you?
-Didn't you see what happened to mine?

544
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,966
Did I shake them? Did you?

545
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,008
No way.

546
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:16,137
You're ignoring me again, aren't you?

547
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:20,350
You asshole.

548
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,313
You really have no customers.
You might go out of business soon.

549
00:32:25,397 --> 00:32:27,482
-Hey!
-Gosh, you startled me.

550
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:29,901
I can hear you
even if you whisper, you know.

551
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:33,446
Do you know how many times
you've stood that guy up?

552
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,658
-Three times?
-It's four.

553
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:39,244
Do you have
some kind of grudge against him?

554
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:41,538
How could I?
I've never even seen him before.

555
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:45,125
But you bailed on him when he said
he'd come to your office building?

556
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:49,504
He even went there during lunchtime
because you said you were so busy.

557
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:50,964
I totally forgot.

558
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,216
You're such a scumbag.

559
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,844
How can you be so arrogant?

560
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:58,638
How can you function as a member
of society like that?

561
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:01,891
People worse than me
are living normal lives in society.

562
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:05,312
Shut up. That guy you bailed on four times

563
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:07,147
must be totally smitten with you.

564
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,482
He says he really wants to meet you.

565
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:10,900
I pity him so much.

566
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:14,112
-Is that so?
-"Is that so?"

567
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,530
You have to see him this time.

568
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,908
If you bail on him again,
I'm going to cut ties with you.

569
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:20,493
All right. I'll go see him.

570
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:23,580
I'm sick of this.

571
00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:25,123
I'm not telling you to date him.

572
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:28,335
Just meet some guys.
At least give it a go.

573
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:30,712
Office, home, and here.
You don't go anywhere else.

574
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:33,423
Your eyes look soulless and empty.

575
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:35,216
There's probably nothing under your skin.

576
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:37,385
Skin!

577
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,471
I want some pork skin. Cook me some.

578
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,556
My gosh. It's like talking to a wall.

579
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:44,642
Let's live soulful lives.

580
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:47,187
Is meeting guys
your idea of a soulful life?

581
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,855
Forget it. I'm just going to work.

582
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:51,566
-Meet someone at work then.
-That's horrible.

583
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,401
You're making me lose my appetite.

584
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:54,402
Then…

585
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,822
Could it be that
you still haven't got over--

586
00:33:57,906 --> 00:34:00,450
Gosh. So this is how you
drive away your customers.

587
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,577
-I'm leaving.
-All right, I'll stop. I'm sorry.

588
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,121
Please sit down, ma'am. I'm sorry.

589
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:08,500
You have such a bad temper.

590
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:13,213
My gosh.

591
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,260
Let me take a break. Jeez.

592
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:20,929
Why are you so bad?

593
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:22,764
You try it then.

594
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:23,890
Goodness.

595
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:28,436
Ung. That live drawing show--

596
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,646
I'm not doing it.

597
00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:30,814
Darn it.

598
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:33,900
Why are you so obsessed
with keeping your identity hidden?

599
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:37,278
You're living in the past.
It's all about communication these days.

600
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:40,532
He's not suited for that.
He can't even talk properly.

601
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,117
I really don't get it.

602
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,160
Five years ago, all you did was draw,

603
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:46,079
saying that you were going to succeed.

604
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:49,082
But now you're rejecting opportunities.
What are you thinking?

605
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:52,419
He's changed now that he's successful.
He's full of himself.

606
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:54,504
-Hey.
-You shouldn't be so arrogant.

607
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:56,798
I heard Nu-a is collaborating with SJ.

608
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:57,882
Who's Nu-a?

609
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:00,885
An artist who has the same style as him.

610
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,762
A rival of his.

611
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,141
"A rival"? You've got to be kidding.

612
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:08,601
Hey, Nu-a's just copying me.

613
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:12,272
At this rate, people will say
you're the one copying Nu-a.

614
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:14,732
Do you want to go back to being a bum
like five years ago?

615
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,236
-Why do you keep bringing up the past?
-So you'll be motivated!

616
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:20,280
Do you really want to live like that?

617
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,365
Jeez.

618
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,663
It wasn't that bad.

619
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,168
What are you on about?

620
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:40,925
Hey.

621
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,385
Let's make a bet.

622
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,887
If you score 15 points first,

623
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:46,514
I'll move
all the cabbages for you tomorrow.

624
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,600
Really?

625
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,312
-Come on.
-I'm game.

626
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:54,189
You won't score a single point.

627
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,461
Ja-gyeong!

628
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:22,133
You reek of alcohol.

629
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:25,011
Did you drink again?

630
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,348
I want to make a doll with your stomach.

631
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,934
Then I can squeeze it every day.

632
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,144
Get washed up and go to bed.

633
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,063
You have to go to work tomorrow.

634
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,107
Just sleep inside, even if I'm late.

635
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:40,527
Don't stay up waiting for me.

636
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,570
I was out here because it was hot.

637
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:44,656
Go and get washed up.

638
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,741
Can't you wash me?

639
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:50,828
-Wash me, Grandma.
-My goodness.

640
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,914
-Give me a kiss.
-What's with you?

641
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:54,707
-You've lost your mind!
-Come on.

642
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,292
What's gotten into you?

643
00:36:57,043 --> 00:37:00,046
-Why?
-You stink! Go away.

644
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:03,716
My goodness. Unbelievable.

645
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,969
How much have you had to drink?

646
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,054
My gosh.

647
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:25,655
ARTIST KO-O

648
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:29,784
KO-O'S SOLO EXHIBITION

649
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,705
KO-O, THE ILLUSTRATOR
WHO PAINTS BUILDINGS WITH SOUL

650
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:45,258
WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST
ABOUT BUILDINGS?

651
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:50,263
YOU DRAW NATURE AS WELL AS BUILDINGS
WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS?

652
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:52,557
CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOUR DRAWING PROCESS?

653
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,185
WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE IN YOUR DRAWINGS?

654
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,814
I LOVE THINGS THAT DON'T CHANGE
BUT PEOPLE CHANGE OR DISAPPEAR OVER TIME

655
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:03,860
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO PEOPLE
OR TIME IN MY WORKS

656
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,922
Ji-ung, our team leader
was looking for you.

657
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,300
I know. He's calling me every ten minutes.

658
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:28,718
Didn't you go home again?

659
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,802
Do I smell?

660
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,179
How many days has it been?

661
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:32,597
It's only my fourth day.

662
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,931
I told you to go home.

663
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,476
Don't make it a habit
of living in the editing room.

664
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,562
Mr. Park said he couldn't
go home at all when he was an assistant.

665
00:38:39,646 --> 00:38:42,190
Hey, don't listen to anything he says.

666
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:44,692
There's nothing worth listening to.

667
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:48,571
-Oh, right. Chae-ran.
-Yes?

668
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:51,866
-Work with me on my next project.
-When I'm done with Mr. Park's.

669
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,035
It's fine. I'm going to steal you away.

670
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,875
Were you looking for me?

671
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:05,546
Do you know what time it is?

672
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:08,758
Let me get a proper break.

673
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:14,639
I'm guessing that you
need me to work my ass off for something.

674
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:16,557
You've gotten smart.

675
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:19,811
I'm telling you in advance.

676
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,188
I'm not doing documentaries
on people anymore.

677
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,023
Why not?

678
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,900
They're boring.

679
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:28,403
I want something related
to the environment. It will be perfect.

680
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:31,197
Environment? Don't you know
how tough that is?

681
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,032
But they're fun.

682
00:39:33,116 --> 00:39:36,202
I heard Yun-jin doesn't want to do it.
Just give that to me.

683
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:41,749
Fine. Do it. I'll give you that one.

684
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:43,960
What?

685
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:46,587
What's going on?

686
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:49,298
What's gotten into you? Are you serious?

687
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:51,134
Do one on people first.

688
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:53,302
Then I'll let you do it. I swear!

689
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:54,971
Jeez. I knew it.

690
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:57,432
You'll never just let me
do something I want.

691
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:00,143
It's a simple one. It's not even a series.

692
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:03,521
Then you can get someone else to do it.
Like Mr. Han.

693
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,066
Hey. Look at this.

694
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:09,193
How about it?

695
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:23,291
<i>Someone who loves me deeply,
someone I can always be with--</i>

696
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:25,752
<i>-Ridiculous.</i>
-My gosh!

697
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:27,462
What? What is it?

698
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:29,172
What is it? Tell me.

699
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:30,548
How could I not know?

700
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,008
Why? Did you find Ko-o?

701
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:35,762
Hey, isn't that Ms. Kook?

702
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:39,140
I saw these videos before.
Why didn't I realize it was her?

703
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,476
Hold on. Is that the view count?

704
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,060
That's crazy.

705
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:44,896
Ms. Kook was harsh back then too.

706
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,565
She talks exactly the same way
as Mr. Jang.

707
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,817
Totally. She seems
harsher in these videos.

708
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,611
This kid's name is Ung.

709
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,821
She was so mean to him.

710
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:56,407
But Ung keeps fighting back.

711
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:59,410
Those two fight like cats and dogs.

712
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:03,414
But from what I remember,
Yeon-su's the one who starts the fight.

713
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:05,082
-Unbelievable.
-Is that so?

714
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,751
Totally.

715
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:10,838
I have the feeling that Yeon-su
has a crush on Ung.

716
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:16,636
Ms. Kook.

717
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:18,346
Hello, Ms. Kook.

718
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:19,972
Ji-un, that thing I asked for…

719
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:21,390
Ms. Kook, when…

720
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:25,770
Am I that similar to Mr. Jang?

721
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:28,147
Who? You?

722
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:30,983
Of course not.
You're much better than him.

723
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:33,236
So I'm just as annoying as he is.

724
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:36,072
-Of course not! We didn't mean that.
-No way!

725
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:40,243
I think the producers
made you look mean in the video.

726
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:43,621
Right. Did you sue them for this?
You really should.

727
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,289
-Right!
-Yes, you should.

728
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:47,500
What is it? Why are you all gathered here?

729
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,751
Is there something fun?

730
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,587
Do any of you know
how to get stuff like that deleted?

731
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,632
Well, it's from a television network,
so you should talk to them.

732
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,802
-Television? What's this about?
-Should I file a complaint?

733
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,470
Are you gathering the data?

734
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:01,764
Of course, we're getting
everything on Ko-o.

735
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:04,517
What is it? Tell me what's going on.

736
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,936
We have to hand over the files
by next week.

737
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,188
I guess you have a lot of time
on your hands.

738
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:13,109
-And Ye-in.
-Yes?

739
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:15,278
It wasn't me. It was him.

740
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:19,198
-What do you mean?
-He picked the fights first.

741
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:23,077
-Ung was always the one who started it.
-Oh, I see.

742
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:27,415
Right. What I meant was…

743
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:30,334
What is it? Tell me.

744
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,253
Come on. Tell me.

745
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:35,089
I won't tell anyone,
so tell me what this is about.

746
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,343
-No.
-Yes.

747
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:40,887
Why do you always say no?

748
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,472
Why would I shoot that again?

749
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:46,267
Don't you see the views?
Look at the comments.

750
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,103
This is the most popular documentary
on our channel.

751
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:50,980
It's just trending for a while.

752
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,441
Plus, it seems like
only kids are watching it.

753
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:55,776
Do you know
what our director's saying these days?

754
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,987
"We have to attract more young viewers."

755
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,741
Can you come up with a better idea
to attract young viewers than this?

756
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:05,244
Do we film anything that has
a lot of views and young viewers?

757
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:06,495
Can't you just do it?

758
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:11,584
Do you know why dating reality shows
are popular these days?

759
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,546
It's even more dramatic
than any of the TV series.

760
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,214
Look at this.

761
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:19,926
There aren't any TV series
that's this entertaining.

762
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,803
If we show how these kids
have changed after ten years,

763
00:43:22,887 --> 00:43:26,015
it'll be epic. I guarantee you.

764
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:30,227
If we do a good job,
we'll get a totally popular documentary.

765
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:32,939
But why would I film that?
You're the one who made it.

766
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:36,192
I'm not young anymore.

767
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,069
I'm old now.

768
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,278
Plus…

769
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:44,617
<i>SCHOOL LIFE PLAYBOOK</i>

770
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,118
<i>Hey, Ji-ung!</i>

771
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:48,663
You must know them the best.

772
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:51,749
Do you still keep in touch with them?

773
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,961
How are they doing? I'm curious myself.

774
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:57,046
It's been ten years.

775
00:43:58,464 --> 00:43:59,799
Have they changed a lot?

776
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:12,979
They all say he's cute.

777
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:14,647
This won't do.

778
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,817
"I'm an acquaintance of Choi Ung."

779
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:21,737
"He's still as weird as he is

780
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,990
in this video."

781
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:26,826
All right.

782
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:31,706
Ung! You have a call!

783
00:44:35,126 --> 00:44:36,293
Ung!

784
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:38,921
Jeez.

785
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:50,558
Ung!

786
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,939
Ung!

787
00:44:57,023 --> 00:44:58,733
Tell him I'll move the cabbages soon.

788
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:01,944
-No, it's not that.
-Do I have to do it now?

789
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:04,530
Look at it.

790
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:06,198
What's with you?

791
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:08,451
Come on. Get it. Hurry!

792
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:09,827
What?

793
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,662
Come on, answer it!

794
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:13,706
Hello?

795
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,875
It's hard to get in touch with you.

796
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,627
I heard you work late at night,
but you wouldn't pick up.

797
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:21,547
And I called you in the morning,
but you still didn't pick up.

798
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,135
Oh, NJ. I didn't know I got a call. Hello.

799
00:45:26,218 --> 00:45:28,345
You must be busier than idol singers.

800
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:31,307
I guess you must be busier
since the articles got out

801
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,184
<i>about me buying your drawing.</i>

802
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:38,272
Right. More people seem to
want to buy my drawings now. Thank you.

803
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,816
Is that it, though?

804
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,153
I want to see more of your work.

805
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:48,824
-What are you doing today?
-Oh, I'm moving cabbages--

806
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:50,701
What?

807
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:52,161
Jeez!

808
00:45:54,497 --> 00:45:57,291
I'm actually moving cabbages--

809
00:45:57,958 --> 00:46:01,420
<i>Do you want to meet up later today?
I want to take a look around your studio.</i>

810
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:03,923
Oh, today?

811
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:07,134
Yes, today. I think I can end early.

812
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,011
I see.

813
00:46:09,095 --> 00:46:10,721
Tell her to come.

814
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:13,724
All right. Then let me know
when you're getting off work.

815
00:46:13,808 --> 00:46:16,727
<i>-Okay. I'll call you later then.</i>
-Okay.

816
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:24,110
Oh, my god! This is crazy!

817
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:29,657
-Were you staying in touch with NJ?
-This is the first time.

818
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,493
When did you exchange numbers?

819
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:34,537
She asked for my number first.

820
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,497
She asked for your number? Why?

821
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,166
I don't know. Get away from me.
You're scaring me.

822
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,252
This is awesome! I can't believe it!

823
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,922
This must be a dream.
Choi Ung had a phone call with NJ.

824
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:46,257
-This is insane.
-But…

825
00:46:47,591 --> 00:46:50,886
She called because she wants
a free drawing, right?

826
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,222
What?

827
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:54,723
I mean…

828
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,685
-"Is that it?" And then she said…
-Is that it?

829
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:00,521
-I want to see more of your work.
-"I want to see more of your work."

830
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:04,358
She wants a drawing for free, right?

831
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:09,405
Ung. NJ just bought a building
worth 15 billion won last week.

832
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:13,033
And just give her one if she asks.
Give her anything she wants.

833
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:16,787
Just give her everything you have!

834
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,998
Give her everything!

835
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,417
Is NJ really coming here?

836
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,544
I can't believe it!

837
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:27,131
-What should I wear?
-Hey, let me see your hands.

838
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,216
What for?

839
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:36,432
If you go through my stuff again,
you're dead.

840
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:38,851
I might die before that.
My heart's about to burst.

841
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:41,812
I've been a fan since her trainee days.
So let me off this time.

842
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:45,691
Do you think it makes sense
for you to be wearing that at home?

843
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:48,777
I guess you're right.

844
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:50,863
-Darn it. What do I wear?
-Jeez.

845
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:52,740
There's nothing to wear.

846
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:54,658
What?

847
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,660
Why are there two of these?

848
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:58,329
-Hey, that's--
-It's tacky.

849
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:01,874
No way.

850
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,251
Is that a matching couple's shirt?

851
00:48:04,877 --> 00:48:06,629
What with the long face?

852
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:08,297
Shut up.

853
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,090
You wore matching t-shirts?

854
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:11,508
How cute.

855
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:14,303
A leather jacket.

856
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:16,472
Would it be too much?

857
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:34,395
Hello. Are you with someone?

858
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,521
Yes.

859
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:50,995
Mr. Jang?

860
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:01,422
This is pretty awkward.

861
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:03,591
What are you doing here alone?

862
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,884
Well, what does it look like?

863
00:49:05,968 --> 00:49:08,178
Your reservation table is this way.

864
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:09,805
Oh, all right.

865
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:40,127
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

866
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,632
You're Choi Ung, right?

867
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:47,843
You were in that documentary.
The worst student.

868
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:52,181
-No, I'm not.
-Come on. You are!

869
00:49:52,264 --> 00:49:54,642
Hey, he said it's not him. Let's go.

870
00:49:56,685 --> 00:50:00,481
I'm sure it's him!
He looks exactly the same.

871
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,940
Mr. Kang Min-su?

872
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:02,900
Yes. Please sit.

873
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:11,950
You finally came.

874
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,037
I'm sorry about last time.

875
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:19,249
-It's fine.
-Well, then shall we…

876
00:50:23,337 --> 00:50:25,339
I still wanted to see you

877
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:28,133
even after being stood up four times

878
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,803
because I wanted to check something.

879
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,180
-What--
-We first set a date

880
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,641
to meet in Yeoido at 7 p.m.,
but you didn't come.

881
00:50:35,724 --> 00:50:38,894
And then we set a date
to meet at Hongdae at eight.

882
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:41,230
You stood me up both times
because of work.

883
00:50:41,313 --> 00:50:43,732
Well, I--

884
00:50:43,816 --> 00:50:45,234
The third was on a weekend.

885
00:50:45,317 --> 00:50:46,735
We were to meet at three,

886
00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:49,822
but you called at five-to
and canceled because of work.

887
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:51,156
The fourth was the lunch yesterday.

888
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,410
We were supposed to meet for 30 minutes
during lunch at your company building,

889
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,286
but you forgot that due to work.

890
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,998
I guess you're doing all the work
at your company.

891
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:02,209
Mr. Kang…

892
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:06,171
So I told your friend for the fifth time
that I wanted to see you.

893
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:10,426
I just couldn't give up like that.

894
00:51:12,761 --> 00:51:15,639
I was worried
that you wouldn't turn up again.

895
00:51:15,723 --> 00:51:17,141
But thank you for coming.

896
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,270
I'm sorry about last time.

897
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:23,439
I was wondering

898
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:27,776
if you were worth
all the time I was wasting,

899
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,821
but I see that you're not.

900
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:34,575
-What?
-This might seem petty…

901
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,580
That's right.
This is why I wanted to see you.

902
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,040
I hope you meet a nice man.

903
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:44,710
Wait…

904
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:48,255
I'm not sure you'll be able to though.

905
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:49,882
Bye, then.

906
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:34,009
Did you hear everything?

907
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:37,012
No.

908
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,938
You say that, but that smile
on your face bothers me.

909
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,481
I could hear everything.

910
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,108
I'd appreciate it
if you could pretend you didn't.

911
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,820
Do you mean about the blind date itself,

912
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,113
or about how you were rejected?

913
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:56,990
Which do you mean?

914
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,412
Your food is ready, sir.

915
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:03,831
Thank you.

916
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:04,957
Enjoy.

917
00:53:09,211 --> 00:53:10,629
Seems like you're eating alone.

918
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:12,840
Mind if I join you?

919
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:16,969
Wouldn't it be awkward
since we're wearing the same shirt?

920
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,764
I think it'll be weirder to eat separately
with the same shirt on.

921
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:24,142
I'll pay for my own food,

922
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:25,727
so just let me sit here.

923
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,357
Fine, then.

924
00:53:44,872 --> 00:53:48,292
<i>Stupid rain… My shoot isn't ending.</i>

925
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,127
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

926
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,713
<i>Could I head over tomorrow morning?</i>

927
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:11,940
Are you going to keep being such a bore?

928
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:14,526
I never considered myself boring.

929
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:20,073
Do you drink alone like this often?

930
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,326
Sometimes, after work.

931
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:25,829
I see. I guess you
must be an empty shell too.

932
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,081
I don't understand.

933
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:33,295
My teammates say that you and I are alike.

934
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,632
I'm not sure. Only our shirts are alike.

935
00:54:36,715 --> 00:54:39,092
I was kind of startled when I heard that.

936
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,012
As I was looking at you,

937
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:46,308
I told myself that
I was much more human than you.

938
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:50,395
Are you drunk?
Or are you pretending to be?

939
00:54:51,229 --> 00:54:52,814
I don't get drunk.

940
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,609
The amount of liquor I can hold
has increased over time.

941
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:11,041
There really isn't anything to talk about.

942
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:14,503
I can talk endlessly about work,

943
00:55:14,586 --> 00:55:16,046
but I don't want to right now.

944
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:18,382
I'm ready to hear anything work-related.

945
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,801
Well, what should I talk about?

946
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:27,683
That shirt.

947
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:29,059
How much was it?

948
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:32,187
I used a discount coupon
and got it really cheap.

949
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,189
I'd be upset if I paid more for it.

950
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:35,565
I paid full price for it.

951
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,402
That's good to hear.

952
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:42,197
But isn't it kind of amazing?

953
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,616
Wearing the same shirt
and coming to the same place.

954
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:48,954
It's my first time wearing
the same clothes as someone else.

955
00:55:49,037 --> 00:55:50,414
This is still quite awkward.

956
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,041
You never wore matching t-shirts?

957
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:55,168
I hate pathetic stuff like that.

958
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,633
I used to hate pathetic things too.

959
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:07,305
But I guess you've

960
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:09,349
done it before.

961
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:12,978
Well, you know…

962
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:15,188
Sometimes you become someone else.

963
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,900
-Is that so?
-I knew it.

964
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:22,863
I really am more human than you.

965
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:24,614
That again?

966
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:28,035
I used to be so childish.

967
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:48,597
Can I have a glass of that wine too?

968
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,141
Wine and soju aren't a great match.

969
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:53,894
It's fine. I enjoy all kinds of alcohol.

970
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,950
Darn it.

971
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:10,869
Gosh, Eun-ho.

972
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:26,593
Jeez.

973
00:57:41,149 --> 00:57:42,192
<i>So…</i>

974
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:45,445
<i>just like ten years ago…</i>

975
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,086
Eun-ho!

976
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:03,463
Darn it!

977
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,473
Jeez!

978
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:15,517
What time is it?

979
00:58:16,435 --> 00:58:18,019
Hey, Eun-ho!

980
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,063
Aren't you going to get the door?

981
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:24,025
<i>…it all happened
regardless of my intentions again.</i>

982
00:58:25,277 --> 00:58:26,319
Who…

983
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:32,617
<i>As if it had to happen.</i>

984
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:39,166
<i>I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.</i>

985
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,252
<i>It's better to just give up.</i>

986
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:45,881
Why? Are they still on bad terms?
Do they still fight all the time?

987
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:53,763
The thing about love and hate is that
there is a very thin line between them.

988
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:55,891
They're two sides of the same coin.

989
00:58:55,974 --> 00:58:57,851
<i>What are you on about?</i>

990
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,686
<i>They were together</i>

991
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,022
<i>for about five years.</i>

992
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,400
<i>They actually dated?</i>

993
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,205
Darn it!

994
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:30,467
-Will you close the door again?
<i>-And they broke up pretty badly.</i>

995
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,095
<i>They hurt each other so much</i>

996
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,806
<i>that they'll probably never
see each other again.</i>

997
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:51,279
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

998
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,001
-What did you say?
-Let's break up.

999
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:07,420
Do you really have to do this now?

1000
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:09,005
Why shouldn't I?

1001
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:10,382
This is the fifth time.

1002
01:00:10,465 --> 01:00:11,591
Two of them were you.

1003
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:13,885
-Do you really mean it? Gosh.
-Yes.

1004
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:15,887
You're at it again.

1005
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:17,973
You just need everything to go your way.

1006
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:19,474
What? What is it this time?

1007
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:23,061
You always make conclusions
by yourself without talking to me.

1008
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,689
You always thought that
about me, didn't you?

1009
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:28,733
-I'm the selfish bitch, aren't I?
-Stop that.

1010
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:31,278
You just don't want to be
the one to break up.

1011
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,155
-Yeon-su.
-I'll be a bitch, just like you wanted.

1012
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,991
So let's end this, okay?

1013
01:00:39,494 --> 01:00:40,954
Yeon-su!

1014
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,667
I bought you that shirt.

1015
01:01:06,074 --> 01:01:09,046
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

1016
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:11,651
<i>I wouldn't have come to see you
if it wasn't for this.</i>

1017
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:12,611
Is that so?

1018
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:15,655
<i>-What?
-So how was it to see her again?</i>

1019
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:18,533
-I don't even remember what I said.
-Are you nuts?

1020
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:20,994
-Do you like me that much or not?
<i>-Hey, don't.</i>

1021
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:22,037
Stop following me.

1022
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:28,585
I think someone is
stealing your car right now.

1023
01:01:28,668 --> 01:01:30,962
They look like a couple
that they're together.

1024
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:32,005
<i>You bastard.</i>

1025
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,715
<i>It's been five years after all.</i>

1026
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:36,051
<i>What if I was serious
and didn't act childish?</i>

1027
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,553
Would you have managed?

1028
