1
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:14,952
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

2
01:00:19,921 --> 01:00:21,339
Should I begin?

3
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:22,382
MAY, 2011

4
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:23,466
Well…

5
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,719
Hello.

6
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:31,266
<i>My name is Choi Ung.</i>

7
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:32,851
CHOI UNG (19, MALE)

8
01:00:32,934 --> 01:00:34,311
Let's look at the first one.

9
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:36,813
As limit x approaches one,

10
01:00:36,897 --> 01:00:39,524
you can find the limiting value.

11
01:00:39,608 --> 01:00:43,236
So we can think about
the case when it's smaller than one

12
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,824
and when it's bigger than one. Understand?

13
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:51,244
-Okay. When it's smaller than one…
-Don't look at the camera.

14
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:54,497
-But it bothers me.
-Just act like it's not here.

15
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:57,417
How can I? It's right in front of me.

16
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,086
For this case, it goes down like this.

17
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,464
<i>-As you can see…</i>
-So the answer is…

18
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:04,090
<i>I'm being filmed.</i>

19
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:05,759
You idiot. Look forward.

20
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:07,844
Should we look at the next one?

21
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:11,389
-The limiting value of this is one.
<i>-But it's not just me.</i>

22
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:13,725
What are you looking at?
Look at the teacher.

23
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:15,936
The limiting value of this is one as well.

24
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:19,898
The limiting values of these are the same…

25
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:22,108
<i>This annoying brat as well.</i>

26
01:01:22,192 --> 01:01:23,318
Let's end it here.

27
01:01:24,778 --> 01:01:26,571
Attention, bow.

28
01:01:27,155 --> 01:01:28,865
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

29
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:31,618
Where are you going?

30
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,412
It's none of your business.

31
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:44,464
Sir, can we stop for a moment?
I can't keep working with that idiot.

32
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,842
-"Idiot"?
-We've been filming for days.

33
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:49,511
Why can't you sit still
when we're filming?

34
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:52,138
I can't focus at all with you next to me.

35
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:54,432
How can I
when there is a camera right next to me?

36
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:57,227
Just focus on the class.
Can't you even do that?

37
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,188
You can ignore me
and focus on class yourself.

38
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:01,147
Can't you even do that?

39
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:04,734
I guess you don't care because
your grades couldn't get any worse.

40
01:02:04,818 --> 01:02:07,404
But I won't let you bring down my grades.

41
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,991
You heard her, right?

42
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:14,452
Whatever. It's your social skills
that couldn't get any worse.

43
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:17,706
Why did I agree to this?

44
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:20,542
I know, right? Why did you agree to this?

45
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:24,587
<i>My name is Kook Yeon-su.</i>

46
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:25,505
KOOK YEON-SU (19, FEMALE)

47
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:28,967
<i>I think I first saw Choi Ung
in tenth grade.</i>

48
01:02:31,136 --> 01:02:32,470
This much again?

49
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,764
I'm reading less
because I have exams soon.

50
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:37,976
You'll read all the books here
by the time you graduate.

51
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,102
Kook Yeon-su…

52
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,106
-Here. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

53
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,446
APRIL'S TOP BOOKWORMS

54
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,072
1ST: CHOI UNG
2ND: KOOK YEON-SU

55
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:55,118
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

56
01:02:55,201 --> 01:02:56,661
Who is Choi Ung?

57
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:58,413
He's in first place this month, too?

58
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:00,206
Oh, Ung?

59
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:02,584
I think he was over there.

60
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:07,922
Hey.

61
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:11,968
<i>I met him somewhere that didn't suit him.</i>

62
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:13,428
I'm Kook Yeon-su from Class 5.

63
01:03:13,511 --> 01:03:15,221
What's your rank?

64
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,015
-What rank?
-Your grades.

65
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:19,809
I'm 267th.

66
01:03:21,394 --> 01:03:23,480
The total number of students here…

67
01:03:23,563 --> 01:03:25,565
There are 267 students.

68
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,486
<i>Back then, I just thought
that he was a strange kid.</i>

69
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:37,243
<i>No, wait. That was the second time we met.</i>

70
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:40,080
<i>The first time we met
was when we started high school.</i>

71
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:43,583
The student who entered with
the highest grades is Kook Yeon-su.

72
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:48,296
Her name's Kook Yeon-su?

73
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,048
What a funny name.

74
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:54,135
I watched her because she walked
like she was entering a battlefield.

75
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:00,725
HWIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

76
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,603
Hey, look at her skirt.

77
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:06,314
-She's obviously a teacher's pet.
-She's a stereotype.

78
01:04:06,397 --> 01:04:09,901
-They all have the same style.
-Hey, look at her shoes.

79
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,945
Even my mom wouldn't wear that.

80
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,906
-Spring is finally here.
-How tacky.

81
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:17,450
The weather is still pretty cold.

82
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:19,369
<i>We met eyes for the first time,</i>

83
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:21,412
<i>so I was trying to be nice by smiling.</i>

84
01:04:21,496 --> 01:04:22,580
Hey.

85
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,249
What are you looking at?

86
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:29,087
<i>But she seemed ill-tempered.</i>

87
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:42,225
<i>Anyway, I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.</i>

88
01:04:43,226 --> 01:04:44,519
You're here.

89
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:46,354
Did you think about that offer?

90
01:04:46,437 --> 01:04:48,231
The producer's a friend of mine.

91
01:04:48,314 --> 01:04:49,732
He won't trouble you too much.

92
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:52,026
You don't have to
if you think it will affect your grades.

93
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:55,196
-Will it be just me?
-No, with one more student.

94
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,242
It's a documentary where
they observe the best and worst students

95
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:01,327
for a month as they spend time together.

96
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:04,372
Anyway, just think about it.

97
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:13,089
Will I be paid if I agree to do it?

98
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:14,549
Of course.

99
01:05:20,305 --> 01:05:23,308
<i>He was the exact opposite of me.</i>

100
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,729
Oh, you're here already.

101
01:05:27,812 --> 01:05:28,980
-Hang on.
-All right.

102
01:05:29,063 --> 01:05:31,858
Just a moment.

103
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:34,986
The ingredients must be here.
Check them thoroughly.

104
01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:37,238
They were in a bad condition last time.

105
01:05:37,322 --> 01:05:39,199
-Check them properly.
-All right.

106
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:43,745
SEAFOOD SOUP WITH UNG
POTATO SOUP WITH UNG

107
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:45,371
CHICKEN FEET WITH UNG

108
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:47,832
-Hello.
-Hello.

109
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:50,627
He's Ung's father.

110
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:52,629
-Hello.
-Hello.

111
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:54,339
Ung!

112
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,341
-Hey. Come over here.
<i>-But things happened</i>

113
01:05:56,424 --> 01:05:58,885
<i>regardless of my intentions.</i>

114
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:00,970
Why didn't you tell us
about the documentary?

115
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:03,014
I said I wouldn't do it.

116
01:06:03,097 --> 01:06:06,684
The producer came all the way here.
Why did you say no?

117
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:09,395
And it's with
the top student in your year.

118
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:10,730
Of course you should do it!

119
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:14,901
Of course! We don't know
what he's doing at school.

120
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:17,445
If you film that,
we'll be able to see what he does.

121
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:19,614
-That's right.
-Thank you.

122
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:21,574
-Thank you.
-I said I'm not doing it!

123
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:23,117
Why would you refuse?

124
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:26,120
Why would I do that?
I don't want everyone to know my face.

125
01:06:26,204 --> 01:06:28,665
You'll be able
to build a great memory with this.

126
01:06:28,748 --> 01:06:30,583
-Right.
-I'm a senior now, you know.

127
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:32,961
Don't you think it will affect my grades?

128
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:36,047
What's he on about?

129
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,925
They are letting you study
with the top student in your grade.

130
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:40,677
You should be grateful!

131
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,678
I mean…

132
01:06:41,761 --> 01:06:44,555
<i>It was as if it had to happen.</i>

133
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,683
She's kind of weird!

134
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:50,436
<i>Anyway, that's how it all started.</i>

135
01:06:55,316 --> 01:06:59,153
Choi Ung from Class 1
will be joining us for a month.

136
01:06:59,237 --> 01:07:00,071
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

137
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:01,447
Be nice to him.

138
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:05,201
It may be distracting for you
since they'll be filming,

139
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:07,245
but it will be a fun experience.

140
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:11,916
And with that,
I hope you all have a great day.

141
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,959
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

142
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:39,360
<i>It was more bothersome than I thought.</i>

143
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:53,499
The worst students make the most fuss.

144
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:57,795
-Are you talking to me?
-Keep your stuff off my desk.

145
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:12,060
<i>She was way more annoying than I thought.</i>

146
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,111
<i>At first, I tried
to become friends with her.</i>

147
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:23,321
Hey…

148
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,170
I'm sorry.

149
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:53,976
Can we…

150
01:09:01,776 --> 01:09:03,194
I said I was sorry.

151
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,489
I'm not sorry.

152
01:09:08,533 --> 01:09:09,701
<i>But what can I do?</i>

153
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:11,744
<i>We're just so different.</i>

154
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:14,664
No! Not here!

155
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:17,542
Darn it.

156
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,377
Go!

157
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:22,213
Here.

158
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:27,927
-Hey.
-Over here!

159
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,806
Oh, my.

160
01:09:32,557 --> 01:09:34,183
Darn it. Hey!

161
01:09:34,892 --> 01:09:35,810
Oh, gosh!

162
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:45,820
Are you okay?

163
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:53,745
<i>He's so childish.</i>

164
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:55,580
Ma'am.

165
01:09:56,664 --> 01:10:00,042
How can I solve that
with the L'Hôpital's rule?

166
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:02,795
Ma'am.

167
01:10:03,337 --> 01:10:07,049
Can we solve this
by using the derived function?

168
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:08,176
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

169
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,720
-Ma'am.
-All right, kids. Enjoy your lunch.

170
01:10:10,803 --> 01:10:12,054
Ma'am.

171
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:15,558
<i>She's so selfish.</i>

172
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:16,642
Ma'am.

173
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:18,728
<i>THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING</i>

174
01:10:20,438 --> 01:10:22,482
I love lying in the shade.

175
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,401
The gentle breeze,

176
01:10:26,861 --> 01:10:28,696
the sunlight shining through the trees…

177
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:34,118
You're so ridiculous.

178
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:37,163
Can you move?

179
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:40,374
Finish reading that
and return it to the library.

180
01:10:48,466 --> 01:10:49,759
This is so nice.

181
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,095
<i>He's so lazy.</i>

182
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,075
Who was that?

183
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,662
Choi Ung! You again?

184
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:19,705
I told you to be quiet!

185
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:23,042
<i>Things are already exhausting,</i>

186
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,503
<i>but she just makes it worse.</i>

187
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:28,631
<i>He's just so pathetic.</i>

188
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,428
Sorry. What was the question?

189
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,472
Pay attention.

190
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:40,101
Oh, things I hate?

191
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:41,352
Kook Yeon-su.

192
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:47,650
I mean, I hate Kook Yeong-su.
She's some girl I know.

193
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:52,280
I hate pathetic beings.
I hate everyone who's pathetic.

194
01:11:52,363 --> 01:11:54,323
Being selfish. I hate selfish people who--

195
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:56,158
People who cause trouble for others.

196
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:59,829
Why can't they just keep to themselves
and not drag others down with them?

197
01:11:59,912 --> 01:12:01,122
Being harsh.

198
01:12:01,205 --> 01:12:02,790
Some people talk without thinking.

199
01:12:02,874 --> 01:12:04,458
They don't think at all.

200
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:06,085
Look who's talking.

201
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:09,463
He just doesn't think at all.

202
01:12:09,547 --> 01:12:12,383
Wait. Are you talking about me?

203
01:12:12,466 --> 01:12:14,719
You seemed to be talking about me too.

204
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:16,971
What? Are you kidding me?

205
01:12:17,054 --> 01:12:18,389
No, I'm totally serious.

206
01:12:19,599 --> 01:12:22,059
Why are you filming this again?

207
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:25,187
It's a show where the top student helps
the student at the bottom of the class.

208
01:12:25,271 --> 01:12:27,064
-Right?
-I see.

209
01:12:27,148 --> 01:12:28,149
Is this some kind of a test

210
01:12:28,232 --> 01:12:30,484
to see how long you can withstand
someone who has no social skills?

211
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:33,863
Doing experiments like that
is pretty unethical.

212
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:37,950
The best student and the worst student.
Which is more anti-social?

213
01:12:38,034 --> 01:12:39,952
When people like her enter society,

214
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:42,705
they will only tire out
the people around them.

215
01:12:42,788 --> 01:12:45,917
Well, you wouldn't even
be able to participate in society.

216
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,710
How would you know?

217
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:54,717
What do you think
you'll be like in ten years?

218
01:12:58,596 --> 01:13:01,015
In ten years, I'll be 29.

219
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:05,519
I'm sure I'd be good at
whatever I'm doing.

220
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,649
I want to live a peaceful life
without doing anything.

221
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:13,694
I'll be leading people around me,
living an active life.

222
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:14,737
A successful life.

223
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,698
I hope I'll live a quiet life.

224
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:19,992
-Anyway…
-One thing I know for sure is that--

225
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,536
…I won't have to see
this annoying face again.

226
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:25,206
That's what I wanted to say.

EPISODE 1
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

236
01:14:14,046 --> 01:14:15,131
<i>This isn't it.</i>

237
01:14:15,214 --> 01:14:16,048
THE PRESENT

238
01:14:16,132 --> 01:14:17,466
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

239
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:19,844
Yes.

240
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:23,556
I don't think you have
anything more to add. Will you continue?

241
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:26,726
<i>This isn't the life I thought I'd live.</i>

242
01:14:28,519 --> 01:14:32,398
But still, please listen
until the end and give me your opinion.

243
01:14:32,982 --> 01:14:34,984
All right, then. Continue.

244
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:37,445
I will explain
the online promotion methods.

245
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:40,990
We're planning on gaining
people's interest before the opening

246
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:44,493
through online campaigns
and participation events.

247
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:46,912
And through hashtag events--

248
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,039
Ms. Kook.

249
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:50,124
This is pretty disappointing.

250
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:52,168
This isn't what we asked for.

251
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:54,045
You should have
checked with us in advance.

252
01:14:54,128 --> 01:14:57,173
Your ideas are too mediocre.

253
01:14:57,256 --> 01:15:00,509
To attract people's interests
before the store opens,

254
01:15:00,593 --> 01:15:03,554
-we should do online--
-Don't you think I know that?

255
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:06,182
-But we--
-Your company's name is Run, right?

256
01:15:06,265 --> 01:15:07,391
You're a small company,

257
01:15:07,475 --> 01:15:09,977
but you won quite a lot of awards,

258
01:15:10,061 --> 01:15:12,354
and I heard you're
quite famous in the industry.

259
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:15,024
But your work is pathetic.

260
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:18,110
You've built up a great image
for your company, I'll give you that.

261
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:21,739
Ji-hyeon. The presentation this afternoon…

262
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:23,866
Can we reschedule it to 10 a.m.?

263
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:26,285
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes? You're done, right?

264
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:27,369
Is there anything else?

265
01:15:27,453 --> 01:15:32,333
<i>Getting looked down on like this
was never part of my plan.</i>

266
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:35,461
-Yes. I'm not done yet.
-Hurry up, then.

267
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:46,889
Offline,
we'll be collaborating with an artist

268
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:48,849
for the opening of Soen Shop.

269
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:51,435
Isn't it cliché to use merch
to attract customers?

270
01:15:51,519 --> 01:15:54,688
It isn't very effective
and is a waste of resources.

271
01:15:54,772 --> 01:15:55,981
Consumers won't fall for--

272
01:15:57,233 --> 01:16:00,569
Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?

273
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:03,989
Go on.

274
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:08,035
This isn't just so that we could
lure in customers with the merchandise.

275
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,498
We'll be merchandising the shop itself
to promote the company.

276
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:18,420
These are the works of Ko-o,
the most popular illustrator these days.

277
01:16:18,504 --> 01:16:22,758
Ko-o is known for drawing detailed
and trendy pieces based on buildings.

278
01:16:22,842 --> 01:16:27,304
And recently, Ko-o received more attention
as the idol singer NJ bought one of them.

279
01:16:28,097 --> 01:16:29,807
Through this collaboration,

280
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,893
we'll host a live drawing show
for the opening ceremony.

281
01:16:34,562 --> 01:16:35,938
Go on.

282
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:39,900
The artist's image matches
the unique and innovative goods

283
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:43,070
that Soen Shop aims
to provide its customers.

284
01:16:43,154 --> 01:16:46,532
Ko-o already has a large fanbase
because of his unique drawings

285
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:48,993
and his sincere attitude toward art.

286
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:51,829
If we promote the shop
with his drawing on the exterior wall,

287
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:56,458
I'm sure it will make Soen Shop
the hottest place to visit.

288
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,759
Can you get the artist on board?

289
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:08,095
Of course. It won't be a problem.

290
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:09,930
You'd better be right.

291
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:12,975
ARTIST KO-O

292
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:14,268
Not bad.

293
01:17:15,102 --> 01:17:18,314
I don't know why you waited
until the last minute to show us that.

294
01:17:18,397 --> 01:17:19,940
-The order--
-You can proceed.

295
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:39,043
Ms. Kook. That was great.
You were so cool today.

296
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:43,380
I heard Mr. Jang is very aggressive.
He sure was scary.

297
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,257
He's doing that on purpose.

298
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:48,302
He called us over this early
so he could have the upper hand.

299
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:50,054
He even kept cutting her off.

300
01:17:50,137 --> 01:17:52,389
But still,
we have this project in the bag now.

301
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:56,352
But Ms. Kook. Can we really
get the artist to work with us?

302
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:59,730
I thought that wasn't confirmed yet.

303
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:02,566
That jerk…

304
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:12,576
When we get back to the office,
get me all the data on the artist.

305
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:15,037
Everything from his social media
to his interviews.

306
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,706
We have to do this project no matter what.

307
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:21,502
But the artist is known
for being a recluse.

308
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:24,630
Nobody's seen his face,
even at exhibitions.

309
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,175
I'm going to find him, no matter what.

310
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:34,056
How could he cut me off like that?

311
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:36,100
Did he never learn any manners?

312
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,519
Jeez, where is my car?

313
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:58,289
Mr. Jang.

314
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,292
Did you have something to say to me?

315
01:19:03,794 --> 01:19:05,963
Are you opening my car door for me?

316
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,006
What?

317
01:19:14,555 --> 01:19:17,933
I'm sorry. I haven't gotten used
to the company car yet.

318
01:19:18,017 --> 01:19:19,059
I was mistaken.

319
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:23,522
-Ms. Kook.
-Yes?

320
01:19:23,605 --> 01:19:25,232
I hate baseless courage.

321
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:28,819
I think irresponsible people
are the most pathetic.

322
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:31,989
-Right.
-I hope you weren't bluffing

323
01:19:32,072 --> 01:19:34,325
when you said you could
get the artist on board.

324
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:36,577
You're not that pathetic, are you?

325
01:19:51,842 --> 01:19:53,761
<i>Ten years ago…</i>

326
01:19:53,844 --> 01:19:55,095
That jerk…

327
01:19:55,179 --> 01:19:58,557
<i>…I would have never imagined</i>

328
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,517
<i>that I'd be treated this way.</i>

329
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:11,320
<i>I had always known</i>

330
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:14,698
<i>that my life would be peaceful.</i>

331
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:20,746
<i>I've always dreamed of this.</i>

332
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:25,250
We started a restaurant
for drivers passing by.

333
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:26,835
-Hang on.
-Why?

334
01:20:26,919 --> 01:20:28,921
Wait. What's he doing?

335
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,507
Stop acting so weird back there.

336
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,884
I have to film Dad,
but you're being distracting.

337
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:36,678
You ruined the shot. It's your fault.

338
01:20:36,762 --> 01:20:39,264
Stop bothering us and go inside.

339
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:41,183
But I was here first.

340
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:43,936
I thought I'd be fine talking
in front of the camera,

341
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:45,521
but it's quite nerve-racking.

342
01:20:45,604 --> 01:20:49,108
<i>-I want a little more peace though.</i>
-Our franchise began

343
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:53,904
as a diner for drivers 25 years ago.

344
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:58,283
We specialized in
steamed fish and chicken feet.

345
01:20:58,367 --> 01:21:00,911
-Then word got around--
-Stop it already!

346
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:02,204
You ruined the shot!

347
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:04,373
He's a busy man, you know.

348
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:06,375
Ung, you should go.
Aren't you late for work?

349
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,584
It's fine. I have time.

350
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:09,294
Then eat something before you go.

351
01:21:10,587 --> 01:21:11,797
Don't you dare!

352
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,090
You little brat.

353
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:15,092
Stop loafing around and work on this.

354
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:18,053
Don't you think I'm busy too?

355
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:19,221
-Nonsense.
-Ridiculous.

356
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:22,224
You? Busy? You're not even working.

357
01:21:22,307 --> 01:21:23,767
-Hey, put that away.
-Come on.

358
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:26,270
He's spending
his precious time helping us.

359
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:27,813
You should be thanking him.

360
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:29,314
You little brat.

361
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:31,650
Finish up and watch the counter.

362
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:32,693
And don't run away.

363
01:21:32,776 --> 01:21:34,695
-Honey, help me with something.
-Wait, I…

364
01:21:34,778 --> 01:21:35,946
I can't do it by myself.

365
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:38,407
Jeez. I'd better go.

366
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:41,869
I told you to stop filming.

367
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:45,205
You'd better stop if you don't
want to lose your fingers or the camera.

368
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,583
What happened to your face?

369
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:52,087
-Even pork is marinated for eight hours.
-What do you mean?

370
01:21:52,171 --> 01:21:54,256
I only slept
two and a half hours last night.

371
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:56,049
I got less rest than pork.

372
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:59,970
That's too bad. You sleep and poop
as much as a pig though.

373
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,763
Shut up. And stop filming!

374
01:22:02,473 --> 01:22:05,476
But I was told to film you too
for the promotional video.

375
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:07,144
No way. Don't you dare.

376
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:08,562
Ung!

377
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:09,563
-Yes?
-Yes?

378
01:22:09,646 --> 01:22:10,772
Ung.

379
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:13,108
Over here. Look at the camera.

380
01:22:15,152 --> 01:22:16,195
That's right.

381
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:18,238
How cute.

382
01:22:23,494 --> 01:22:25,204
-Look over here.
-Ung! Look at Mommy.

383
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:26,330
-Ung! Over here.
-That's right.

384
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:28,290
-Look at your teacher.
-How cute!

385
01:22:28,373 --> 01:22:29,416
Hang on.

386
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,210
Look at your teacher. Yes, good.

387
01:22:31,293 --> 01:22:33,003
-Look over there.
-He grew a lot.

388
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:35,047
-It must be because your husband is tall.
-Look at your teacher.

389
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,840
Is he listening to his teacher?

390
01:22:36,924 --> 01:22:38,342
I bought this for today.

391
01:22:38,425 --> 01:22:40,219
"Choi Ung"?

392
01:22:40,302 --> 01:22:43,263
Yes. I'm Choi Ung. What's your name?

393
01:22:43,347 --> 01:22:44,806
I'm not going to tell you.

394
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:49,186
KIM JI-UNG

395
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:50,479
<i>Not you. Ji-ung.</i>

396
01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:51,730
Do you want some stew?

397
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:53,899
-Yes, I'd love that.
-What about me?

398
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:55,317
You can have some too.

399
01:22:56,735 --> 01:22:59,446
Hey, I've been thinking…

400
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:01,823
I'll practice my lines properly,

401
01:23:01,907 --> 01:23:05,160
so would it be okay
to do this again when you have time?

402
01:23:05,244 --> 01:23:08,622
Anytime is fine with me.
So call me when you want to do it.

403
01:23:09,623 --> 01:23:13,794
Thank you so much.
It's so nice having a producer help out.

404
01:23:13,877 --> 01:23:15,754
When else would I be able to try this?

405
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:19,967
Dad. Don't look at me like that.

406
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,969
The cabbages are arriving later, okay?

407
01:23:22,052 --> 01:23:25,013
Don't you dare think about running away
and move them inside.

408
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:28,559
I hope you're not forgetting
that I'm your son!

409
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,020
-Have two bowls, alright?
-Okay.

410
01:23:32,563 --> 01:23:36,692
It seems like you'll be the one
inheriting the restaurant later.

411
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:39,361
My parents are acting
like you're their son these days.

412
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:42,197
But think about it.

413
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:44,449
I act more like their son than you.

414
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:45,576
Jeez.

415
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,035
Aren't you working these days?

416
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,038
Why do you keep lurking around here
and threatening my status?

417
01:23:50,122 --> 01:23:52,874
I finally got a short vacation
after finishing a program.

418
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:56,086
I'll be busy again
when I start my next project.

419
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:58,589
I should have fun here before that.

420
01:23:58,672 --> 01:24:01,550
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

421
01:24:01,633 --> 01:24:03,927
-I'm having fun.
-You jerk!

422
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:06,930
Wait! Father, look at Ung
holding the bean sprouts like that!

423
01:24:07,014 --> 01:24:08,765
-I wasn't--
-Put that down!

424
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:10,142
Put it down.

425
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:11,643
-Put it down!
-Don't play around with that!

426
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:12,936
You're dead, you jerk!

427
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,647
-How can you be so childish?
-My goodness.

428
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:17,149
You're a grown-up, you know!

429
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:21,653
<i>I thought I'd have matured
a bit more than this though.</i>

430
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,492
Ms. Kook and Mr. Jang
were clashing since they're so similar.

431
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:29,536
It's so fun watching them argue.

432
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,539
You saw how Ms. Kook reacted
when Mr. Jang cut her off

433
01:24:32,623 --> 01:24:34,625
during her presentation, right?

434
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:38,712
"Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?" Unbelievable.

435
01:24:38,796 --> 01:24:41,423
But still, Ms. Kook was so cool.
Don't you think so?

436
01:24:41,507 --> 01:24:42,883
She's cool.

437
01:24:42,966 --> 01:24:45,969
It wasn't something a small company
like us can easily get.

438
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:48,096
But she's getting that opportunity for us.

439
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,641
She's almost like
the breadwinner of this family.

440
01:24:50,724 --> 01:24:52,601
Our CEO's good luck charm.

441
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:55,229
But imagine if we get on her bad side.

442
01:24:55,312 --> 01:24:58,816
She's so dependable
when she's fighting our clients,

443
01:24:58,899 --> 01:25:00,692
but if she ever gets angry at us…

444
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:02,820
Polar bears tear people apart
with their paws,

445
01:25:02,903 --> 01:25:05,864
but Ms. Kook tears people with her words…
How did it go, Ms. Kook?

446
01:25:06,448 --> 01:25:09,243
The data I asked for on Ko-o.

447
01:25:09,326 --> 01:25:10,953
Have them ready by 3 p.m.

448
01:25:11,036 --> 01:25:12,287
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

449
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,253
What's going on here? What is it?

450
01:25:19,336 --> 01:25:21,255
Why are you guys so good?

451
01:25:21,338 --> 01:25:23,382
I heard you were given the green light.

452
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:25,300
I was so shocked.

453
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:26,927
Good work.

454
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:31,223
And I can't believe Ms. Kook
succeeded again.

455
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,100
Today's a day to celebrate.

456
01:25:33,183 --> 01:25:34,726
-We should--
-No gatherings.

457
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,353
I'm not suggesting a team dinner.

458
01:25:36,436 --> 01:25:38,230
Why would we do such a thing?

459
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:41,400
We shouldn't be having
a company gathering at a time like this.

460
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:42,609
We all hate it.

461
01:25:43,527 --> 01:25:44,778
Then how about

462
01:25:44,862 --> 01:25:46,697
-dinner--
-How about lunch instead?

463
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:49,575
You don't want to waste
your dinnertime with me?

464
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:51,952
That's not what I mean.
It's going to be hard

465
01:25:52,035 --> 01:25:53,829
to get off work on time.

466
01:25:53,912 --> 01:25:55,706
Then should we go have lunch now?

467
01:25:56,582 --> 01:25:58,250
We already had lunch, sir.

468
01:26:01,003 --> 01:26:02,421
What do you mean?

469
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:03,589
I just remembered

470
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:07,009
that we all had lunch together
on the way back.

471
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:12,639
What about me? Why didn't you invite me?

472
01:26:12,723 --> 01:26:16,977
You didn't attend the presentation
because you had a stomachache.

473
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,646
So we thought you'd skip lunch.

474
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:22,482
Right. That was smart thinking.

475
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,944
Then you don't want dinner,
and you already ate lunch.

476
01:26:26,028 --> 01:26:27,195
What should I do, then?

477
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,907
Then how about some coffee?

478
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,408
-Yes.
-Coffee sounds great.

479
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:33,535
-You all have coffee.
-We have coffee.

480
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:35,412
You already have coffee.

481
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:37,372
You all have some.

482
01:26:37,456 --> 01:26:38,957
-Yes.
-Fine.

483
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:41,668
-Why don't I get you some porridge, then?
-Don't worry.

484
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:44,963
I hate porridge.

485
01:26:46,465 --> 01:26:47,633
He seems upset.

486
01:27:00,395 --> 01:27:02,230
SOL-I

487
01:27:08,445 --> 01:27:15,452
SEOUL HARDWARE STORE

488
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:45,477
What is it?

489
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,687
<i>You wench! Why weren't you picking up?</i>

490
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:53,151
Why weren't you picking up?

491
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:55,821
Jeez. Don't you see that I'm working?

492
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:58,073
But still, you should answer your phone.

493
01:29:58,156 --> 01:29:59,908
Darn it…

494
01:29:59,991 --> 01:30:01,076
What?

495
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:03,870
What are you doing? Hey!

496
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:05,163
Get up. Exercise time.

497
01:30:05,247 --> 01:30:07,249
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

498
01:30:07,332 --> 01:30:09,793
Get up. You said you're not sleeping well.

499
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:11,670
Stop it! Let go of me!

500
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:16,883
It's the manager's job
to take care of the artist's health too.

501
01:30:19,344 --> 01:30:21,972
I'm already exhausted,
and he makes it worse.

502
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:24,641
Aren't I a great manager? I'm so kind.

503
01:30:24,724 --> 01:30:25,892
You're fired.

504
01:30:25,976 --> 01:30:27,561
That counts as wrongful dismissal.

505
01:30:27,644 --> 01:30:30,021
We'll stop when we
make it over there. You can do it.

506
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:31,273
I can't.

507
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:32,816
You have to go. Come on.

508
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:34,276
-Jeez.
-One, two, three, four.

509
01:30:34,359 --> 01:30:35,652
Two, two, three, four.

510
01:30:35,735 --> 01:30:37,904
All right! We're here!

511
01:30:37,988 --> 01:30:39,406
Over here. Hurry up.

512
01:30:39,489 --> 01:30:40,907
Hey! What's that?

513
01:30:40,991 --> 01:30:42,409
The flag. Make the goal.

514
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:46,163
-There you go.
-Yes, goal!

515
01:30:48,874 --> 01:30:51,126
You guys are doing all kinds
of stupid things.

516
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:53,545
I heard you only slept
two and a half hours.

517
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:56,590
-You have such a big mouth.
-Me? Take this.

518
01:30:56,673 --> 01:30:57,883
Gosh.

519
01:30:57,966 --> 01:31:00,260
Aren't you supposed to be busy?
Did you get fired?

520
01:31:00,343 --> 01:31:02,888
Hey, if you're skilled,
you can slack off all you want.

521
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:08,435
Right. Did you still not
tell your parents what you do?

522
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:10,395
They just know I'm drawing.

523
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:13,815
They called me a while ago
and asked if you make enough money

524
01:31:13,899 --> 01:31:16,401
since they couldn't find anything
when they searched your name.

525
01:31:16,484 --> 01:31:17,903
Didn't you tell them anything?

526
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:20,530
How much do you earn? Tell me.

527
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:22,699
You're not even telling your family?

528
01:31:22,782 --> 01:31:24,784
You're being overly secretive.

529
01:31:24,868 --> 01:31:27,204
-Darn it.
-Jeez!

530
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:30,498
-You shook it, didn't you?
-No. So how much does he earn?

531
01:31:30,582 --> 01:31:32,876
Each drawing sells for…

532
01:31:34,127 --> 01:31:35,795
-What? For real?
-Yes.

533
01:31:36,504 --> 01:31:37,339
Son of a bitch.

534
01:31:38,548 --> 01:31:41,801
Hey. You just
wanted to swear at me, right?

535
01:31:41,885 --> 01:31:42,844
Of course not.

536
01:31:42,928 --> 01:31:45,138
Son of a bitch. What?

537
01:31:46,139 --> 01:31:49,392
Oh, right. I told Father
that you didn't move the cabbages.

538
01:31:49,476 --> 01:31:51,019
He said he'll kill you tomorrow.

539
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:53,563
-Oh, my. What are you going to do?
-Darn it.

540
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:02,072
Why is the weather so nice today?

541
01:32:11,164 --> 01:32:12,791
-Jeez!
-Jeez!

542
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,751
You idiots.

543
01:32:14,834 --> 01:32:17,921
-You shook these, didn't you?
-Didn't you see what happened to mine?

544
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:20,966
Did I shake them? Did you?

545
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:22,008
No way.

546
01:32:23,843 --> 01:32:26,137
You're ignoring me again, aren't you?

547
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:30,350
You asshole.

548
01:32:31,851 --> 01:32:35,313
You really have no customers.
You might go out of business soon.

549
01:32:35,397 --> 01:32:37,482
-Hey!
-Gosh, you startled me.

550
01:32:37,565 --> 01:32:39,901
I can hear you
even if you whisper, you know.

551
01:32:39,985 --> 01:32:43,446
Do you know how many times
you've stood that guy up?

552
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,658
-Three times?
-It's four.

553
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:49,244
Do you have
some kind of grudge against him?

554
01:32:49,327 --> 01:32:51,538
How could I?
I've never even seen him before.

555
01:32:51,621 --> 01:32:55,125
But you bailed on him when he said
he'd come to your office building?

556
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:59,504
He even went there during lunchtime
because you said you were so busy.

557
01:32:59,587 --> 01:33:00,964
I totally forgot.

558
01:33:01,715 --> 01:33:03,216
You're such a scumbag.

559
01:33:03,883 --> 01:33:05,844
How can you be so arrogant?

560
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:08,638
How can you function as a member
of society like that?

561
01:33:09,347 --> 01:33:11,891
People worse than me
are living normal lives in society.

562
01:33:12,475 --> 01:33:15,312
Shut up. That guy you bailed on four times

563
01:33:15,395 --> 01:33:17,147
must be totally smitten with you.

564
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,482
He says he really wants to meet you.

565
01:33:19,566 --> 01:33:20,900
I pity him so much.

566
01:33:21,526 --> 01:33:24,112
-Is that so?
-"Is that so?"

567
01:33:24,195 --> 01:33:25,530
You have to see him this time.

568
01:33:25,613 --> 01:33:28,908
If you bail on him again,
I'm going to cut ties with you.

569
01:33:28,992 --> 01:33:30,493
All right. I'll go see him.

570
01:33:32,078 --> 01:33:33,580
I'm sick of this.

571
01:33:33,663 --> 01:33:35,123
I'm not telling you to date him.

572
01:33:35,206 --> 01:33:38,335
Just meet some guys.
At least give it a go.

573
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:40,712
Office, home, and here.
You don't go anywhere else.

574
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:43,423
Your eyes look soulless and empty.

575
01:33:43,506 --> 01:33:45,216
There's probably nothing under your skin.

576
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:47,385
Skin!

577
01:33:48,053 --> 01:33:49,471
I want some pork skin. Cook me some.

578
01:33:49,554 --> 01:33:51,556
My gosh. It's like talking to a wall.

579
01:33:52,432 --> 01:33:54,642
Let's live soulful lives.

580
01:33:54,726 --> 01:33:57,187
Is meeting guys
your idea of a soulful life?

581
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:58,855
Forget it. I'm just going to work.

582
01:33:58,938 --> 01:34:01,566
-Meet someone at work then.
-That's horrible.

583
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:03,401
You're making me lose my appetite.

584
01:34:03,485 --> 01:34:04,402
Then…

585
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,822
Could it be that
you still haven't got over--

586
01:34:07,906 --> 01:34:10,450
Gosh. So this is how you
drive away your customers.

587
01:34:10,533 --> 01:34:12,577
-I'm leaving.
-All right, I'll stop. I'm sorry.

588
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,121
Please sit down, ma'am. I'm sorry.

589
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:18,500
You have such a bad temper.

590
01:34:22,128 --> 01:34:23,213
My gosh.

591
01:34:26,925 --> 01:34:29,260
Let me take a break. Jeez.

592
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:30,929
Why are you so bad?

593
01:34:31,012 --> 01:34:32,764
You try it then.

594
01:34:32,847 --> 01:34:33,890
Goodness.

595
01:34:36,434 --> 01:34:38,436
Ung. That live drawing show--

596
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,646
I'm not doing it.

597
01:34:39,729 --> 01:34:40,814
Darn it.

598
01:34:40,897 --> 01:34:43,900
Why are you so obsessed
with keeping your identity hidden?

599
01:34:43,983 --> 01:34:47,278
You're living in the past.
It's all about communication these days.

600
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:50,532
He's not suited for that.
He can't even talk properly.

601
01:34:50,615 --> 01:34:52,117
I really don't get it.

602
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,160
Five years ago, all you did was draw,

603
01:34:54,244 --> 01:34:56,079
saying that you were going to succeed.

604
01:34:56,162 --> 01:34:59,082
But now you're rejecting opportunities.
What are you thinking?

605
01:34:59,165 --> 01:35:02,419
He's changed now that he's successful.
He's full of himself.

606
01:35:02,502 --> 01:35:04,504
-Hey.
-You shouldn't be so arrogant.

607
01:35:04,587 --> 01:35:06,798
I heard Nu-a is collaborating with SJ.

608
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:07,882
Who's Nu-a?

609
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:10,885
An artist who has the same style as him.

610
01:35:10,969 --> 01:35:12,762
A rival of his.

611
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:16,141
"A rival"? You've got to be kidding.

612
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,601
Hey, Nu-a's just copying me.

613
01:35:18,685 --> 01:35:22,272
At this rate, people will say
you're the one copying Nu-a.

614
01:35:22,355 --> 01:35:24,732
Do you want to go back to being a bum
like five years ago?

615
01:35:24,816 --> 01:35:28,236
-Why do you keep bringing up the past?
-So you'll be motivated!

616
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:30,280
Do you really want to live like that?

617
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:32,365
Jeez.

618
01:35:36,661 --> 01:35:38,663
It wasn't that bad.

619
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,168
What are you on about?

620
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:50,925
Hey.

621
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:52,385
Let's make a bet.

622
01:35:52,469 --> 01:35:53,887
If you score 15 points first,

623
01:35:54,429 --> 01:35:56,514
I'll move
all the cabbages for you tomorrow.

624
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,600
Really?

625
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:02,312
-Come on.
-I'm game.

626
01:36:02,395 --> 01:36:04,189
You won't score a single point.

627
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:26,461
Ja-gyeong!

628
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:32,133
You reek of alcohol.

629
01:36:32,217 --> 01:36:35,011
Did you drink again?

630
01:36:35,094 --> 01:36:38,348
I want to make a doll with your stomach.

631
01:36:38,431 --> 01:36:40,934
Then I can squeeze it every day.

632
01:36:41,017 --> 01:36:43,144
Get washed up and go to bed.

633
01:36:43,228 --> 01:36:45,063
You have to go to work tomorrow.

634
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:48,107
Just sleep inside, even if I'm late.

635
01:36:48,191 --> 01:36:50,527
Don't stay up waiting for me.

636
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:52,570
I was out here because it was hot.

637
01:36:52,654 --> 01:36:54,656
Go and get washed up.

638
01:36:55,365 --> 01:36:56,741
Can't you wash me?

639
01:36:57,867 --> 01:37:00,828
-Wash me, Grandma.
-My goodness.

640
01:37:00,912 --> 01:37:02,914
-Give me a kiss.
-What's with you?

641
01:37:03,498 --> 01:37:04,707
-You've lost your mind!
-Come on.

642
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:06,292
What's gotten into you?

643
01:37:07,043 --> 01:37:10,046
-Why?
-You stink! Go away.

644
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:13,716
My goodness. Unbelievable.

645
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,969
How much have you had to drink?

646
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:18,054
My gosh.

647
01:37:34,195 --> 01:37:35,655
ARTIST KO-O

648
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:39,784
KO-O'S SOLO EXHIBITION

649
01:37:41,369 --> 01:37:43,705
KO-O, THE ILLUSTRATOR
WHO PAINTS BUILDINGS WITH SOUL

650
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:55,258
WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST
ABOUT BUILDINGS?

651
01:37:58,177 --> 01:38:00,263
YOU DRAW NATURE AS WELL AS BUILDINGS
WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS?

652
01:38:00,346 --> 01:38:02,557
CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOUR DRAWING PROCESS?

653
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:06,185
WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE IN YOUR DRAWINGS?

654
01:38:06,269 --> 01:38:09,814
I LOVE THINGS THAT DON'T CHANGE
BUT PEOPLE CHANGE OR DISAPPEAR OVER TIME

655
01:38:09,897 --> 01:38:13,860
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO PEOPLE
OR TIME IN MY WORKS

656
01:38:32,879 --> 01:38:34,922
Ji-ung, our team leader
was looking for you.

657
01:38:35,006 --> 01:38:37,300
I know. He's calling me every ten minutes.

658
01:38:37,383 --> 01:38:38,718
Didn't you go home again?

659
01:38:38,801 --> 01:38:39,802
Do I smell?

660
01:38:39,886 --> 01:38:41,179
How many days has it been?

661
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:42,597
It's only my fourth day.

662
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,931
I told you to go home.

663
01:38:44,015 --> 01:38:46,476
Don't make it a habit
of living in the editing room.

664
01:38:46,559 --> 01:38:49,562
Mr. Park said he couldn't
go home at all when he was an assistant.

665
01:38:49,646 --> 01:38:52,190
Hey, don't listen to anything he says.

666
01:38:52,273 --> 01:38:54,692
There's nothing worth listening to.

667
01:38:56,653 --> 01:38:58,571
-Oh, right. Chae-ran.
-Yes?

668
01:38:58,655 --> 01:39:01,866
-Work with me on my next project.
-When I'm done with Mr. Park's.

669
01:39:01,949 --> 01:39:04,035
It's fine. I'm going to steal you away.

670
01:39:09,457 --> 01:39:10,875
Were you looking for me?

671
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:15,546
Do you know what time it is?

672
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:18,758
Let me get a proper break.

673
01:39:20,802 --> 01:39:24,639
I'm guessing that you
need me to work my ass off for something.

674
01:39:25,223 --> 01:39:26,557
You've gotten smart.

675
01:39:28,267 --> 01:39:29,811
I'm telling you in advance.

676
01:39:29,894 --> 01:39:32,188
I'm not doing documentaries
on people anymore.

677
01:39:32,814 --> 01:39:34,023
Why not?

678
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:35,900
They're boring.

679
01:39:35,983 --> 01:39:38,403
I want something related
to the environment. It will be perfect.

680
01:39:38,486 --> 01:39:41,197
Environment? Don't you know
how tough that is?

681
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,032
But they're fun.

682
01:39:43,116 --> 01:39:46,202
I heard Yun-jin doesn't want to do it.
Just give that to me.

683
01:39:48,996 --> 01:39:51,749
Fine. Do it. I'll give you that one.

684
01:39:52,917 --> 01:39:53,960
What?

685
01:39:55,211 --> 01:39:56,587
What's going on?

686
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:59,298
What's gotten into you? Are you serious?

687
01:39:59,382 --> 01:40:01,134
Do one on people first.

688
01:40:01,217 --> 01:40:03,302
Then I'll let you do it. I swear!

689
01:40:03,386 --> 01:40:04,971
Jeez. I knew it.

690
01:40:05,054 --> 01:40:07,432
You'll never just let me
do something I want.

691
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:10,143
It's a simple one. It's not even a series.

692
01:40:10,226 --> 01:40:13,521
Then you can get someone else to do it.
Like Mr. Han.

693
01:40:15,356 --> 01:40:17,066
Hey. Look at this.

694
01:40:18,067 --> 01:40:19,193
How about it?

695
01:40:29,829 --> 01:40:33,291
<i>Someone who loves me deeply,
someone I can always be with--</i>

696
01:40:33,374 --> 01:40:35,752
<i>-Ridiculous.</i>
-My gosh!

697
01:40:35,835 --> 01:40:37,462
What? What is it?

698
01:40:38,045 --> 01:40:39,172
What is it? Tell me.

699
01:40:39,255 --> 01:40:40,548
How could I not know?

700
01:40:40,631 --> 01:40:42,008
Why? Did you find Ko-o?

701
01:40:43,468 --> 01:40:45,762
Hey, isn't that Ms. Kook?

702
01:40:45,845 --> 01:40:49,140
I saw these videos before.
Why didn't I realize it was her?

703
01:40:49,223 --> 01:40:51,476
Hold on. Is that the view count?

704
01:40:51,559 --> 01:40:53,060
That's crazy.

705
01:40:53,144 --> 01:40:54,896
Ms. Kook was harsh back then too.

706
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,565
She talks exactly the same way
as Mr. Jang.

707
01:40:57,648 --> 01:40:59,817
Totally. She seems
harsher in these videos.

708
01:40:59,901 --> 01:41:01,611
This kid's name is Ung.

709
01:41:01,694 --> 01:41:03,821
She was so mean to him.

710
01:41:03,905 --> 01:41:06,407
But Ung keeps fighting back.

711
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:09,410
Those two fight like cats and dogs.

712
01:41:09,494 --> 01:41:13,414
But from what I remember,
Yeon-su's the one who starts the fight.

713
01:41:13,498 --> 01:41:15,082
-Unbelievable.
-Is that so?

714
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,751
Totally.

715
01:41:17,335 --> 01:41:20,838
I have the feeling that Yeon-su
has a crush on Ung.

716
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:26,636
Ms. Kook.

717
01:41:27,136 --> 01:41:28,346
Hello, Ms. Kook.

718
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:29,972
Ji-un, that thing I asked for…

719
01:41:30,556 --> 01:41:31,390
Ms. Kook, when…

720
01:41:31,974 --> 01:41:35,770
Am I that similar to Mr. Jang?

721
01:41:35,853 --> 01:41:38,147
Who? You?

722
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:40,983
Of course not.
You're much better than him.

723
01:41:41,067 --> 01:41:43,236
So I'm just as annoying as he is.

724
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:46,072
-Of course not! We didn't mean that.
-No way!

725
01:41:46,155 --> 01:41:50,243
I think the producers
made you look mean in the video.

726
01:41:50,326 --> 01:41:53,621
Right. Did you sue them for this?
You really should.

727
01:41:53,704 --> 01:41:55,289
-Right!
-Yes, you should.

728
01:41:55,373 --> 01:41:57,500
What is it? Why are you all gathered here?

729
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:58,751
Is there something fun?

730
01:41:58,835 --> 01:42:01,587
Do any of you know
how to get stuff like that deleted?

731
01:42:01,671 --> 01:42:04,632
Well, it's from a television network,
so you should talk to them.

732
01:42:04,715 --> 01:42:07,802
-Television? What's this about?
-Should I file a complaint?

733
01:42:07,885 --> 01:42:09,470
Are you gathering the data?

734
01:42:09,554 --> 01:42:11,764
Of course, we're getting
everything on Ko-o.

735
01:42:11,848 --> 01:42:14,517
What is it? Tell me what's going on.

736
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,936
We have to hand over the files
by next week.

737
01:42:17,019 --> 01:42:19,188
I guess you have a lot of time
on your hands.

738
01:42:21,357 --> 01:42:23,109
-And Ye-in.
-Yes?

739
01:42:23,192 --> 01:42:25,278
It wasn't me. It was him.

740
01:42:26,195 --> 01:42:29,198
-What do you mean?
-He picked the fights first.

741
01:42:29,282 --> 01:42:33,077
-Ung was always the one who started it.
-Oh, I see.

742
01:42:33,828 --> 01:42:37,415
Right. What I meant was…

743
01:42:37,498 --> 01:42:40,334
What is it? Tell me.

744
01:42:40,418 --> 01:42:42,253
Come on. Tell me.

745
01:42:42,336 --> 01:42:45,089
I won't tell anyone,
so tell me what this is about.

746
01:42:47,758 --> 01:42:49,343
-No.
-Yes.

747
01:42:49,427 --> 01:42:50,887
Why do you always say no?

748
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:53,472
Why would I shoot that again?

749
01:42:53,556 --> 01:42:56,267
Don't you see the views?
Look at the comments.

750
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:59,103
This is the most popular documentary
on our channel.

751
01:42:59,186 --> 01:43:00,980
It's just trending for a while.

752
01:43:01,063 --> 01:43:03,441
Plus, it seems like
only kids are watching it.

753
01:43:03,524 --> 01:43:05,776
Do you know
what our director's saying these days?

754
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,987
"We have to attract more young viewers."

755
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:11,741
Can you come up with a better idea
to attract young viewers than this?

756
01:43:11,824 --> 01:43:15,244
Do we film anything that has
a lot of views and young viewers?

757
01:43:15,328 --> 01:43:16,495
Can't you just do it?

758
01:43:17,371 --> 01:43:21,584
Do you know why dating reality shows
are popular these days?

759
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:25,546
It's even more dramatic
than any of the TV series.

760
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:27,214
Look at this.

761
01:43:27,298 --> 01:43:29,926
There aren't any TV series
that's this entertaining.

762
01:43:30,009 --> 01:43:32,803
If we show how these kids
have changed after ten years,

763
01:43:32,887 --> 01:43:36,015
it'll be epic. I guarantee you.

764
01:43:36,098 --> 01:43:40,227
If we do a good job,
we'll get a totally popular documentary.

765
01:43:40,311 --> 01:43:42,939
But why would I film that?
You're the one who made it.

766
01:43:44,649 --> 01:43:46,192
I'm not young anymore.

767
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:48,069
I'm old now.

768
01:43:48,152 --> 01:43:49,278
Plus…

769
01:43:53,783 --> 01:43:54,617
<i>SCHOOL LIFE PLAYBOOK</i>

770
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,118
<i>Hey, Ji-ung!</i>

771
01:43:56,911 --> 01:43:58,663
You must know them the best.

772
01:43:58,746 --> 01:44:01,749
Do you still keep in touch with them?

773
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:04,961
How are they doing? I'm curious myself.

774
01:44:05,044 --> 01:44:07,046
It's been ten years.

775
01:44:08,464 --> 01:44:09,799
Have they changed a lot?

776
01:44:21,686 --> 01:44:22,979
They all say he's cute.

777
01:44:23,062 --> 01:44:24,647
This won't do.

778
01:44:25,231 --> 01:44:27,817
"I'm an acquaintance of Choi Ung."

779
01:44:28,484 --> 01:44:31,737
"He's still as weird as he is

780
01:44:32,363 --> 01:44:33,990
in this video."

781
01:44:35,741 --> 01:44:36,826
All right.

782
01:44:39,745 --> 01:44:41,706
Ung! You have a call!

783
01:44:45,126 --> 01:44:46,293
Ung!

784
01:44:47,837 --> 01:44:48,921
Jeez.

785
01:44:59,306 --> 01:45:00,558
Ung!

786
01:45:04,103 --> 01:45:06,939
Ung!

787
01:45:07,023 --> 01:45:08,733
Tell him I'll move the cabbages soon.

788
01:45:08,816 --> 01:45:11,944
-No, it's not that.
-Do I have to do it now?

789
01:45:12,445 --> 01:45:14,530
Look at it.

790
01:45:14,613 --> 01:45:16,198
What's with you?

791
01:45:16,282 --> 01:45:18,451
Come on. Get it. Hurry!

792
01:45:18,534 --> 01:45:19,827
What?

793
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:21,662
Come on, answer it!

794
01:45:22,538 --> 01:45:23,706
Hello?

795
01:45:23,789 --> 01:45:25,875
It's hard to get in touch with you.

796
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:28,627
I heard you work late at night,
but you wouldn't pick up.

797
01:45:28,711 --> 01:45:31,547
And I called you in the morning,
but you still didn't pick up.

798
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:36,135
Oh, NJ. I didn't know I got a call. Hello.

799
01:45:36,218 --> 01:45:38,345
You must be busier than idol singers.

800
01:45:38,929 --> 01:45:41,307
I guess you must be busier
since the articles got out

801
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:43,184
<i>about me buying your drawing.</i>

802
01:45:43,851 --> 01:45:48,272
Right. More people seem to
want to buy my drawings now. Thank you.

803
01:45:48,939 --> 01:45:50,816
Is that it, though?

804
01:45:51,942 --> 01:45:54,153
I want to see more of your work.

805
01:45:55,321 --> 01:45:58,824
-What are you doing today?
-Oh, I'm moving cabbages--

806
01:45:59,617 --> 01:46:00,701
What?

807
01:46:00,785 --> 01:46:02,161
Jeez!

808
01:46:04,497 --> 01:46:07,291
I'm actually moving cabbages--

809
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:11,420
<i>Do you want to meet up later today?
I want to take a look around your studio.</i>

810
01:46:12,213 --> 01:46:13,923
Oh, today?

811
01:46:14,006 --> 01:46:17,134
Yes, today. I think I can end early.

812
01:46:17,802 --> 01:46:19,011
I see.

813
01:46:19,095 --> 01:46:20,721
Tell her to come.

814
01:46:20,805 --> 01:46:23,724
All right. Then let me know
when you're getting off work.

815
01:46:23,808 --> 01:46:26,727
<i>-Okay. I'll call you later then.</i>
-Okay.

816
01:46:31,357 --> 01:46:34,110
Oh, my god! This is crazy!

817
01:46:36,362 --> 01:46:39,657
-Were you staying in touch with NJ?
-This is the first time.

818
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:42,493
When did you exchange numbers?

819
01:46:42,576 --> 01:46:44,537
She asked for my number first.

820
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,497
She asked for your number? Why?

821
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,166
I don't know. Get away from me.
You're scaring me.

822
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:51,252
This is awesome! I can't believe it!

823
01:46:51,335 --> 01:46:54,922
This must be a dream.
Choi Ung had a phone call with NJ.

824
01:46:55,005 --> 01:46:56,257
-This is insane.
-But…

825
01:46:57,591 --> 01:47:00,886
She called because she wants
a free drawing, right?

826
01:47:02,012 --> 01:47:03,222
What?

827
01:47:03,305 --> 01:47:04,723
I mean…

828
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:07,685
-"Is that it?" And then she said…
-Is that it?

829
01:47:07,768 --> 01:47:10,521
-I want to see more of your work.
-"I want to see more of your work."

830
01:47:11,564 --> 01:47:14,358
She wants a drawing for free, right?

831
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:19,405
Ung. NJ just bought a building
worth 15 billion won last week.

832
01:47:19,488 --> 01:47:23,033
And just give her one if she asks.
Give her anything she wants.

833
01:47:23,117 --> 01:47:26,787
Just give her everything you have!

834
01:47:26,871 --> 01:47:28,998
Give her everything!

835
01:47:29,081 --> 01:47:31,417
Is NJ really coming here?

836
01:47:32,042 --> 01:47:33,544
I can't believe it!

837
01:47:34,378 --> 01:47:37,131
-What should I wear?
-Hey, let me see your hands.

838
01:47:38,257 --> 01:47:39,216
What for?

839
01:47:43,637 --> 01:47:46,432
If you go through my stuff again,
you're dead.

840
01:47:46,515 --> 01:47:48,851
I might die before that.
My heart's about to burst.

841
01:47:48,934 --> 01:47:51,812
I've been a fan since her trainee days.
So let me off this time.

842
01:47:51,896 --> 01:47:55,691
Do you think it makes sense
for you to be wearing that at home?

843
01:47:57,484 --> 01:47:58,777
I guess you're right.

844
01:47:59,278 --> 01:48:00,863
-Darn it. What do I wear?
-Jeez.

845
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:02,740
There's nothing to wear.

846
01:48:03,532 --> 01:48:04,658
What?

847
01:48:05,409 --> 01:48:06,660
Why are there two of these?

848
01:48:06,744 --> 01:48:08,329
-Hey, that's--
-It's tacky.

849
01:48:10,623 --> 01:48:11,874
No way.

850
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:14,251
Is that a matching couple's shirt?

851
01:48:14,877 --> 01:48:16,629
What with the long face?

852
01:48:17,213 --> 01:48:18,297
Shut up.

853
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,090
You wore matching t-shirts?

854
01:48:20,174 --> 01:48:21,508
How cute.

855
01:48:22,843 --> 01:48:24,303
A leather jacket.

856
01:48:25,387 --> 01:48:26,472
Would it be too much?

857
01:48:42,518 --> 01:48:44,395
Hello. Are you with someone?

858
01:48:44,478 --> 01:48:45,521
Yes.

859
01:48:59,702 --> 01:49:00,995
Mr. Jang?

860
01:49:09,378 --> 01:49:11,422
This is pretty awkward.

861
01:49:12,089 --> 01:49:13,591
What are you doing here alone?

862
01:49:13,674 --> 01:49:15,884
Well, what does it look like?

863
01:49:15,968 --> 01:49:18,178
Your reservation table is this way.

864
01:49:18,262 --> 01:49:19,805
Oh, all right.

865
01:49:49,126 --> 01:49:50,127
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

866
01:49:53,005 --> 01:49:54,632
You're Choi Ung, right?

867
01:49:55,132 --> 01:49:57,843
You were in that documentary.
The worst student.

868
01:49:59,428 --> 01:50:02,181
-No, I'm not.
-Come on. You are!

869
01:50:02,264 --> 01:50:04,642
Hey, he said it's not him. Let's go.

870
01:50:06,685 --> 01:50:10,481
I'm sure it's him!
He looks exactly the same.

871
01:50:10,564 --> 01:50:11,940
Mr. Kang Min-su?

872
01:50:12,024 --> 01:50:12,900
Yes. Please sit.

873
01:50:20,366 --> 01:50:21,950
You finally came.

874
01:50:22,576 --> 01:50:25,037
I'm sorry about last time.

875
01:50:25,788 --> 01:50:29,249
-It's fine.
-Well, then shall we…

876
01:50:33,337 --> 01:50:35,339
I still wanted to see you

877
01:50:36,006 --> 01:50:38,133
even after being stood up four times

878
01:50:38,759 --> 01:50:40,803
because I wanted to check something.

879
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:43,180
-What--
-We first set a date

880
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:45,641
to meet in Yeoido at 7 p.m.,
but you didn't come.

881
01:50:45,724 --> 01:50:48,894
And then we set a date
to meet at Hongdae at eight.

882
01:50:48,977 --> 01:50:51,230
You stood me up both times
because of work.

883
01:50:51,313 --> 01:50:53,732
Well, I--

884
01:50:53,816 --> 01:50:55,234
The third was on a weekend.

885
01:50:55,317 --> 01:50:56,735
We were to meet at three,

886
01:50:56,819 --> 01:50:59,822
but you called at five-to
and canceled because of work.

887
01:50:59,905 --> 01:51:01,156
The fourth was the lunch yesterday.

888
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,410
We were supposed to meet for 30 minutes
during lunch at your company building,

889
01:51:04,493 --> 01:51:06,286
but you forgot that due to work.

890
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:09,998
I guess you're doing all the work
at your company.

891
01:51:10,082 --> 01:51:12,209
Mr. Kang…

892
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:16,171
So I told your friend for the fifth time
that I wanted to see you.

893
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:20,426
I just couldn't give up like that.

894
01:51:22,761 --> 01:51:25,639
I was worried
that you wouldn't turn up again.

895
01:51:25,723 --> 01:51:27,141
But thank you for coming.

896
01:51:28,475 --> 01:51:31,270
I'm sorry about last time.

897
01:51:32,104 --> 01:51:33,439
I was wondering

898
01:51:34,022 --> 01:51:37,776
if you were worth
all the time I was wasting,

899
01:51:39,153 --> 01:51:40,821
but I see that you're not.

900
01:51:42,114 --> 01:51:44,575
-What?
-This might seem petty…

901
01:51:47,369 --> 01:51:49,580
That's right.
This is why I wanted to see you.

902
01:51:50,748 --> 01:51:52,040
I hope you meet a nice man.

903
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:54,710
Wait…

904
01:51:55,377 --> 01:51:58,255
I'm not sure you'll be able to though.

905
01:51:58,922 --> 01:51:59,882
Bye, then.

906
01:52:41,757 --> 01:52:44,009
Did you hear everything?

907
01:52:45,844 --> 01:52:47,012
No.

908
01:52:52,059 --> 01:52:55,938
You say that, but that smile
on your face bothers me.

909
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:57,481
I could hear everything.

910
01:52:57,564 --> 01:53:00,108
I'd appreciate it
if you could pretend you didn't.

911
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:02,820
Do you mean about the blind date itself,

912
01:53:02,903 --> 01:53:05,113
or about how you were rejected?

913
01:53:05,197 --> 01:53:06,990
Which do you mean?

914
01:53:10,577 --> 01:53:12,412
Your food is ready, sir.

915
01:53:12,496 --> 01:53:13,831
Thank you.

916
01:53:13,914 --> 01:53:14,957
Enjoy.

917
01:53:19,211 --> 01:53:20,629
Seems like you're eating alone.

918
01:53:21,213 --> 01:53:22,840
Mind if I join you?

919
01:53:24,007 --> 01:53:26,969
Wouldn't it be awkward
since we're wearing the same shirt?

920
01:53:27,761 --> 01:53:30,764
I think it'll be weirder to eat separately
with the same shirt on.

921
01:53:30,848 --> 01:53:34,142
I'll pay for my own food,

922
01:53:34,226 --> 01:53:35,727
so just let me sit here.

923
01:53:39,106 --> 01:53:40,357
Fine, then.

924
01:53:54,872 --> 01:53:58,292
<i>Stupid rain… My shoot isn't ending.</i>

925
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:00,127
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

926
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:02,713
<i>Could I head over tomorrow morning?</i>

927
01:54:19,521 --> 01:54:21,940
Are you going to keep being such a bore?

928
01:54:22,024 --> 01:54:24,526
I never considered myself boring.

929
01:54:27,529 --> 01:54:30,073
Do you drink alone like this often?

930
01:54:30,157 --> 01:54:32,326
Sometimes, after work.

931
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:35,829
I see. I guess you
must be an empty shell too.

932
01:54:36,663 --> 01:54:38,081
I don't understand.

933
01:54:39,207 --> 01:54:43,295
My teammates say that you and I are alike.

934
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:46,632
I'm not sure. Only our shirts are alike.

935
01:54:46,715 --> 01:54:49,092
I was kind of startled when I heard that.

936
01:54:49,843 --> 01:54:52,012
As I was looking at you,

937
01:54:52,095 --> 01:54:56,308
I told myself that
I was much more human than you.

938
01:54:57,392 --> 01:55:00,395
Are you drunk?
Or are you pretending to be?

939
01:55:01,229 --> 01:55:02,814
I don't get drunk.

940
01:55:02,898 --> 01:55:05,609
The amount of liquor I can hold
has increased over time.

941
01:55:19,122 --> 01:55:21,041
There really isn't anything to talk about.

942
01:55:22,084 --> 01:55:24,503
I can talk endlessly about work,

943
01:55:24,586 --> 01:55:26,046
but I don't want to right now.

944
01:55:26,129 --> 01:55:28,382
I'm ready to hear anything work-related.

945
01:55:28,465 --> 01:55:30,801
Well, what should I talk about?

946
01:55:36,348 --> 01:55:37,683
That shirt.

947
01:55:37,766 --> 01:55:39,059
How much was it?

948
01:55:39,142 --> 01:55:42,187
I used a discount coupon
and got it really cheap.

949
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,189
I'd be upset if I paid more for it.

950
01:55:44,272 --> 01:55:45,565
I paid full price for it.

951
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:48,402
That's good to hear.

952
01:55:50,445 --> 01:55:52,197
But isn't it kind of amazing?

953
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,616
Wearing the same shirt
and coming to the same place.

954
01:55:55,784 --> 01:55:58,954
It's my first time wearing
the same clothes as someone else.

955
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:00,414
This is still quite awkward.

956
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:03,041
You never wore matching t-shirts?

957
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:05,168
I hate pathetic stuff like that.

958
01:56:08,422 --> 01:56:11,633
I used to hate pathetic things too.

959
01:56:15,637 --> 01:56:17,305
But I guess you've

960
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:19,349
done it before.

961
01:56:20,267 --> 01:56:22,978
Well, you know…

962
01:56:23,061 --> 01:56:25,188
Sometimes you become someone else.

963
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,900
-Is that so?
-I knew it.

964
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:32,863
I really am more human than you.

965
01:56:33,405 --> 01:56:34,614
That again?

966
01:56:35,407 --> 01:56:38,035
I used to be so childish.

967
01:56:55,302 --> 01:56:58,597
Can I have a glass of that wine too?

968
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,141
Wine and soju aren't a great match.

969
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:03,894
It's fine. I enjoy all kinds of alcohol.

970
01:57:17,657 --> 01:57:18,950
Darn it.

971
01:57:19,034 --> 01:57:20,869
Gosh, Eun-ho.

972
01:57:35,425 --> 01:57:36,593
Jeez.

973
01:57:51,149 --> 01:57:52,192
<i>So…</i>

974
01:57:53,485 --> 01:57:55,445
<i>just like ten years ago…</i>

975
01:58:09,626 --> 01:58:11,086
Eun-ho!

976
01:58:12,462 --> 01:58:13,463
Darn it!

977
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,473
Jeez!

978
01:58:24,182 --> 01:58:25,517
What time is it?

979
01:58:26,435 --> 01:58:28,019
Hey, Eun-ho!

980
01:58:28,562 --> 01:58:30,063
Aren't you going to get the door?

981
01:58:30,147 --> 01:58:34,025
<i>…it all happened
regardless of my intentions again.</i>

982
01:58:35,277 --> 01:58:36,319
Who…

983
01:58:41,575 --> 01:58:42,617
<i>As if it had to happen.</i>

984
01:58:46,288 --> 01:58:49,166
<i>I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.</i>

985
01:58:50,625 --> 01:58:52,252
<i>It's better to just give up.</i>

986
01:58:52,335 --> 01:58:55,881
Why? Are they still on bad terms?
Do they still fight all the time?

987
01:59:00,093 --> 01:59:03,763
The thing about love and hate is that
there is a very thin line between them.

988
01:59:03,847 --> 01:59:05,891
They're two sides of the same coin.

989
01:59:05,974 --> 01:59:07,851
<i>What are you on about?</i>

990
01:59:07,934 --> 01:59:09,686
<i>They were together</i>

991
01:59:09,769 --> 01:59:12,022
<i>for about five years.</i>

992
01:59:12,105 --> 01:59:15,400
<i>They actually dated?</i>

993
01:59:26,953 --> 01:59:28,205
Darn it!

994
01:59:37,172 --> 01:59:40,467
-Will you close the door again?
<i>-And they broke up pretty badly.</i>

995
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,095
<i>They hurt each other so much</i>

996
01:59:44,179 --> 01:59:46,806
<i>that they'll probably never
see each other again.</i>

997
01:59:54,272 --> 02:00:01,279
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

998
02:00:13,458 --> 02:00:15,001
-What did you say?
-Let's break up.

999
02:00:15,085 --> 02:00:17,420
Do you really have to do this now?

1000
02:00:17,504 --> 02:00:19,005
Why shouldn't I?

1001
02:00:19,089 --> 02:00:20,382
This is the fifth time.

1002
02:00:20,465 --> 02:00:21,591
Two of them were you.

1003
02:00:21,675 --> 02:00:23,885
-Do you really mean it? Gosh.
-Yes.

1004
02:00:25,011 --> 02:00:25,887
You're at it again.

1005
02:00:25,971 --> 02:00:27,973
You just need everything to go your way.

1006
02:00:28,056 --> 02:00:29,474
What? What is it this time?

1007
02:00:29,558 --> 02:00:33,061
You always make conclusions
by yourself without talking to me.

1008
02:00:33,687 --> 02:00:35,689
You always thought that
about me, didn't you?

1009
02:00:35,772 --> 02:00:38,733
-I'm the selfish bitch, aren't I?
-Stop that.

1010
02:00:38,817 --> 02:00:41,278
You just don't want to be
the one to break up.

1011
02:00:41,361 --> 02:00:44,155
-Yeon-su.
-I'll be a bitch, just like you wanted.

1012
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:45,991
So let's end this, okay?

1013
02:00:49,494 --> 02:00:50,954
Yeon-su!

1014
02:00:54,374 --> 02:00:55,667
I bought you that shirt.

1015
02:01:16,074 --> 02:01:19,046
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

1016
02:01:19,941 --> 02:01:21,651
<i>I wouldn't have come to see you
if it wasn't for this.</i>

1017
02:01:21,735 --> 02:01:22,611
Is that so?

1018
02:01:23,445 --> 02:01:25,655
<i>-What?
-So how was it to see her again?</i>

1019
02:01:25,739 --> 02:01:28,533
-I don't even remember what I said.
-Are you nuts?

1020
02:01:29,576 --> 02:01:30,994
-Do you like me that much or not?
<i>-Hey, don't.</i>

1021
02:01:31,077 --> 02:01:32,037
Stop following me.

1022
02:01:32,912 --> 02:01:38,585
I think someone is
stealing your car right now.

1023
02:01:38,668 --> 02:01:40,962
They look like a couple
that they're together.

1024
02:01:41,046 --> 02:01:42,005
<i>You bastard.</i>

1025
02:01:42,088 --> 02:01:43,715
<i>It's been five years after all.</i>

1026
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:46,051
<i>What if I was serious
and didn't act childish?</i>

1027
02:01:46,926 --> 02:01:48,553
Would you have managed?

1028
